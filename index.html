    <h2> Four Reasons to Choose Copywriting for Healthcare for Your Next Project… </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> <strong>Experience:</strong> I’ve spent years working with doctors and other medical professionals. As a Music Therapist, my job included reading and writing hundreds of medical reports. I’ll help you persuade healthcare decision-makers by using medical language.</li>
      <li><strong>Assessment Skills:</strong> As a therapist, I’ve learned to interview clients, establish objectives, and track progress. We’ll establish marketing goals and choose appropriate metrics to increase ROI. </li>
      <li> <strong>Technology:</strong> For the past eight years, I’ve been training young students to use technology. I’ve learned from experience how to teach tech concepts in simple language. When I explain your telehealth solutions, your customers won’t be mystified—they’ll be excited to buy from you.</li>
      <li>  <strong>Research:</strong> Hire someone who is trained to research and check facts thoroughly. I’ve taken four psychology research classes at <a href="http://www.pacific.edu">University of the Pacific</a>. If you’re looking for scientific evidence to back your latest white paper, or you need information about your competition, my research skills can help.</li>
