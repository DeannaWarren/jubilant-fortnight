Plus, I’ve read over 20 books on writing and marketing in the last year, alone… books like Influence by Robert Cialdini and Ogilvy on Advertising by David Ogilvy.</p>

<p>A. I’ve worked in mental hospitals, nursing homes and schools. I’ve collaborated with doctors, nurses, psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers, and I’m also a therapist myself.
