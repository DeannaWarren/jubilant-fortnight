# Julibant Fortnight- aka Copywriting for Healthcare 2.0
## This is the current live software

_Current Assessment_: (7-10-16) The codebase is a hot mess, but it's up and running. Next step will be to organize assets (pages/images) and work on consolidating the standard head code out of the commented out section and into my custom head. 

## About this Project
As the technical cofounder of Copywriting For Healthcare, I am setting up our website and blog, alongside other tech related duties. 

I am using __Jekyll__ for the first time so that I can spend less time writing and modifying HTML files and spend more time developing a tool that can be more streamlined for our business. It is already allowing for ....

This will eventually be overtaken by a Ruby app when I have completed one to my satisfaction. The main hurdle there will be making sure to maintain the URI structure of Jekyll so that any links are maintained. The benefit will be in allowing my product and marketing cofounder take the lead on updating blogs, freeing my time for more tech upgrades to our work pipeline.
