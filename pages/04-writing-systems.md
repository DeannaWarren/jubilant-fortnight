<h3> Contact and Communications Policies </h3>

<p>As we work together, it is important that we have fast and easy communication. During our projects, I am available Monday through Friday, 9 AM to 5 PM Pacific time. By far, the best <a href="/contact">way to reach me</a> is through email at Craig@CopywritingForHealthcare.com. If you need to contact me regarding an urgent matter, please call me at (831)704-8159.</p>

<h3> Discussing the Project and Questionnaire </h3>

<p> To get started with a potential project, I’ll send you a complete Discovery Questionnaire. This Questionnaire will help us define the scope of the project and ensure maximum results. When you email me back, I’ll send you a link to the Questionnaire. Please return it to me as quickly as possible— this generally takes clients 1 to 3 business days. </p>

<p> Once I receive your Discovery Questionnaire, I review and study your answers, plus conduct initial research when needed. From there, I will outline a short Project Roadmap. This roadmap will save you time and help you see that I fully understand the project. It will also be the basis for our launch call.</p>

<p> We will schedule a 20-minute Launch Call within 3-10 days after I receive the Discovery Questionnaire answers. During this call, we will discuss the Project Roadmap. I will listen to any additional directions and insights you have on the project. Following that call, I will draft and send you an Agreement. If your legal team has an agreement, we can use that instead.  </p>

<h3> Investment and Getting Started </h3>

<p> The Agreement will detail all the specifics of exactly what I will deliver, project milestones, investment totals, and payment terms. You’ll know exactly what to expect from me and when to expect it, from day one. (Note: I require 50% of the project total to get started. Many clients prefer to pay via bank wire or overnight payment.) Once we have both signed the agreement, I will begin working on your copy.</p>

<h3> Research </h3>

<p> I believe that thorough research is important to writing the best copy possible. To offer you the best value, I have developed a comprehensive research process, which includes a review of your website, social media, and any other materials you provide. From there, I research the market and your competitors. In some cases, I may ask to visit with your customer service team, past clients/customers, and department heads. You can rest assured that I will keep all of your client information secure and confidential. </p>

<p> As needed, I will reach out to you for additional details, product samples, and other resources. You can be confident that I’ll quickly and effectively understand your products, your voice, and your client’s core emotional purchase drivers. I can help you discover your client’s needs through thorough research, and I’m familiar with technology terminology and quickly learn anything tech-related that I don’t already know.</p>

<h3> Collaboration </h3>

<p> As we work on this project together, communication is critical. Some of my clients are very busy, and they prefer to hand off the project to me and review the first draft, with little communication in between. Others like dealing with me on an almost daily basis and stay involved at just about every step of the project. Which are you? Please <a href="/contact">send me an email</a> and let me know how often you like to communicate and how best to reach you (e.g. email, phone, social media, etc.) </p>

<p> One other point… I require that you assign me a single contact person on your team. I will communicate directly with this person, and they will communicate with your other team members, as needed, to obtain information and approvals. </p>

<p> Finally, I STRONGLY encourage you to become familiar with Dropbox. I do much of my writing with this tool. It allows us to share files and folders. Documents can be shared with various team members, and the working document is always the current document — no need to worry about sending wrong files or things getting lost.</p>

<h3> Review of First Draft </h3>

<p> Typically, you’ll receive the first draft in 10-14 business days, depending on the project size and amount of research required. When you get the first draft, please review it carefully. Also, have any applicable team members review it. The most important thing at this stage of the game is making sure that the tone, message and offer are right. We’ll fine-tune during the second draft… and third draft, as needed.</p>

<h3> Revisions </h3>

<p> After you review the first draft, it is likely that you’ll want some things changed. Please note these changes in the Dropbox file and send them to me. I will review all your suggested changes within 24 hours after you submit them to me. I will make my adjustments within 2-4 business days, depending on the breadth and complexity of your suggested changes. </p>

<p> In all cases, I will recognize that these are your customers and will defer to you as much as possible. Sometimes, there are cases where my clients make suggestions that I know will not work and will hurt their profits. In those cases, you can expect me to be bold and direct in my feedback. When clients insist on changes that I feel will not work, I always recommend a simple A/B split test. Let the market vote.</p>

<h3> Additional Reviews </h3>

<p> After the first round of changes, there may be some additional fine-tuning needed. You can be confident that I’ll gladly work with you until you are delighted with the copy. In most cases, my clients find that one review volley is sufficient. When more volleys are needed, it’s  usually just one or two, and the process goes quickly. Typically, we can get to a final copy within 1-3 business days.</p>

<h3> Final Approval </h3>

<p> Once all final revisions are complete, I will send you a final draft. At this point, you approve the copy by emailing me and stating that everything is ready for distribution. Once I receive your final approval, I will invoice you for the remaining 50% of the project investment. The invoice is due upon receipt. I will make every effort to be prompt in responding to your requests, and I assume that, as a professional, you will do the same with my invoices. </p>

<p> In most cases, the final copy is sent to a designer for formatting. I strongly encourage you to send me a PDF of the final version. I will double-check that any graphical elements added by your design team enhance the copy and make it more effective. If I see something that is distracting and may hurt your response rates, I’ll be direct in letting you know. If requested, I’m happy to work with your design team to make any changes needed to make the end version as effective as possible. </p>

<h3> Transition to New Projects </h3>

<p> Once the project is finished, I provide all of my clients with a complementary follow-up consultation. We spend a few minutes on the phone to discuss what went well and where improvements can be made. We review the Discovery Questionnaire and discuss additional ways to uncover new profits. Where appropriate, we map out a new project to ensure you continue to have excellent copy that meets your goals and grows your business. </p>
