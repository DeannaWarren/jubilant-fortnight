After over a month blogging, I’m searching for ways to save time and keep up with my content schedule. I’ve decided to scale back from 3 weekly blog posts to 1-2 posts per week. That way, I’ll keep producing quality content for you, the reader, and I'll also have more time for client work. 

If you’re busy and struggling to produce enough content every week, should you give up on your blog? 

No. Not if you want to beat your competition--especially if you're a small business owner. Small businesses with blogs [generate 126% more leads](http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2013/10/create-great-content-get-more-repurposing/) than businesses without them. But what should you do if writing your posts takes too much time out of your already busy schedule?

The answer: You can save time and effort by repurposing your content. 

### Repurposing Your Content Benefits You, AND Your Readers, Too

Repurposing content benefits your readers when you produce material in different formats for various learning styles--podcasts for auditory learners, videos for visual learners, etc. Repurposing your content also expands your audience through increased exposure and the ability to share different types of content through various channels. 

[Cross-promotion](https://searchenginewatch.com/sew/how-to/2265878/repurposing-content-top-benefits-techniques-tools) will help when you're launching a new blog, as well because you have an endless number of opportunities to [promote your content.](http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/03/repurposing-content)

Repurposing content also increases your perceived [authority[(https://blog.bufferapp.com/repurposing-content-guide) when you publish multiple articles on a single subject relevant to your industry. Publishing content in multiple channels also raises your search engine ranking for specific keywords and generates backlinks. 

### Which Content Should You Repurpose?

[Candice Lazar](http://www.awaionline.com/2016/06/effective-content-writing-tips/) recommended repurposing:

* Evergreen content: Repurpose the content containing unique information your readers will find relevant long after you published it. Also consider updating evergreen content with outdated references or examples.
* Popular content: Use Google Analytics to determine your most read content. After publishing a popular article, maintain the momentum with follow-ups, posts from new angles, and expert interviews.
* Labor-intensive content: You spent time and effort to produce a high-quality piece of content. Repurposing it yields more shares in exchange for your effort and also gives your readers another opportunity to consume the content.

### 14 Ways to Repurpose Your Blog Articles

Depending on the subject and the level of detail in the content, there are several ways to repurpose your blog material:

* Summarize multiple articles into 1 blog post or curated list
* Expand a listicle of tips into a series of articles, covering each tip in depth individually
* Republish an article as a guest post on another blog
* Combine a series of articles into a comprehensive guide or white paper, which you then share as an email series
* Compile multiple expert interviews and create an e-book
* Rewrite a Quora answer as a blog post, which you can share on Quora as well
* Repurpose your blog post as a podcast
* Turn your post into [visual content](https://www.quicksprout.com/the-complete-guide-to-building-your-blog-audience-chapter-10/), such as an infographic or animation slideshow,
* Transform a series of articles into a training video or webinar
* Promote [user-generated content](http://www.convinceandconvert.com/content-marketing/how-to-repurpose-content/) and create a thank you post to acknowledge your community's support
* Write [case studies](http://optinmonster.com/40-ways-to-repurpose-blog-content/) based on a topic you previously wrote about

Additionally, you can repurpose your content for increased promotion when you:

* Share your blog posts in a tip-oriented email newsletter
* Create [social media posts](http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/how-to-repurpose-your-content/) with quotes from your blog
* Republish your content on [Medium,](https://medium.com/) and other blogging platforms
* Share your post on syndication networks such as [Outbrain](http://www.outbrain.com/) and [Zemanta](http://www.zemanta.com/) 

One final point: don't be afraid of recycling your content and [repeating yourself.]http://codelessinteractive.com/repurpose-blog/) over and over. Even if they subscribe to your newsletter, many of your readers will miss some of your articles or won't read all of your content. Even if they do, repetition is beneficial because it helps them understand your ideas and remember them more clearly. 

Writing this post has given me new ideas for my own blog. Most likely, I'll be repurposing my content and sharing it with you in the near future. And if you're writing your own blog, feel free to repurpose your own content and create something new.
