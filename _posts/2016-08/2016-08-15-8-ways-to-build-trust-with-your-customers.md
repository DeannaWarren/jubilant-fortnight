Driving with my father this past weekend, he mentioned hearing a grinding sound when he accelerates. His mechanic hasn't fixed his car yet because he is unavailable. The mechanic is so busy because my dad and many others trust and rely on him to keep their cars running. How has the mechanic gained the trust of his customers, and why should you do likewise?

### Why Building Trust with Your Customers Increases Your Business

You want to build trust so your customers feel comfortable buying from you. Once they buy from you, maintaining their trust keeps them satisfied with your service. 

Retaining customers also adds more value to your business with opportunities to upsell them on new products and services. Gaining repeat business from satisfied customers is also more efficient and less costly than attracting new ones. According to [HubSpot,](http://elevatoragency.com/notes-from-san-diego-hubspot-user-group-sdhug-on-january-14-2016/) 65% of customers have cut ties with a brand over just 1 bad experience, so maintaining trust is crucial to maintain customer relationships. Conversely, according to [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/yec/2014/04/22/three-ways-to-build-customer-trust/#110ca3ec78db), 83% of customers will recommend a trusted brand to others, and 82% will continue to use the product or service. So, it's important to build customer relationships and maintain trust. How do you build and maintain trust with your customers?

### 1. Educate Your Customers with Content

According to [Mark Schaefer](http://www.convinceandconvert.com/digital-marketing/why-you-should-build-trust/), 70% of customers are more likely to buy your product if they first see a friend share content about your brand. Therefore, content is important because it turns your customers into brand advocates and helps them inform their followers about your brand.

If you empower your customer through education and information, they'll see you as an expert. When you're providing them information on a frequent basis, your prospects will remember you when they’re ready to buy.

Publishing content is one of the best ways to share information with your prospects. When preparing your content strategy, develop buyer personas and examine the buyer's journey to determine what content interests your prospects. Defining buyer personas will help you respond to customer inquiries and exceed their expectations during every interaction. Content will help to generate curiosity and get the customer [asking questions](http://www.forentrepreneurs.com/build-trusted-relationships/).

### 2. Build Trust Through Personal Stories 

 Use every opportunity to show your customers how you're like them. People are naturally attracted to others similar to them, and sharing stories helps them see how your lives are similar. Stories from CEO's can tell the journey of the founder and the company. Stories of overcoming struggles, righting injustices, and making the world a better place are universally appealing. 

Testimonials are an important part of the sales funnel because they demonstrate the product's value and prove its real world application. Customer stories are more powerful when they're told by customers and written in their own words.

Testimonials and reviews from customers, experts, industry thought leaders, and well-known figures are all beneficial.

[Reviews](http://www.clickbank.com/4-ways-to-build-trust-with-your-customers/) are also beneficial because they are seen as impartial. Encourage customers to leave testimonials and reviews to include on your website.

### 3. Putting Faces to Names Builds Trust 

To build trust, you need to demonstrate as much [transparency](http://www.mcorpcx.com/five-ways-to-earn-customer-trust/) as possible and demonstrate you have nothing to hide.
Just like telling stories, sharing your names and faces with your customers helps create a personal connection. Customers like to buy from other people, not from faceless corporations. You can use phone conversations, videos and demos, podcasts, and face-to-face conversations to build rapport. Sharing your photos in emails and on your website builds credibility as well.

### 4. Use Social Proof to Add Credibility 

We like to follow trends and be a part of what others are engaged in. Therefore, you can build trust by sharing how many people use your product or service. For example, McDonald’s signs claim “Billions and Billions served”. 

### 5. Offer Free or Low Cost Trials 

Often, customers are not completely ready to trust you. Or, they're unsure if your service is for them. Offering a free or low-cost trial lets them try the service before investing in it long term. [OpenForum](https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/openforum/articles/how-to-get-customers-to-trust-you/) recommends collecting credit card information after the free trial concludes, which gets more customers to try and then stay with your service.

### 6. Explain Your Procedures and Processes 

When a prospect signs up for an email list, use thank you pages and emails to tell them what the next step will be. Knowing what to expect reduces uncertainty, which makes them more likely to proceed further down the sales funnel.

### 7. Build Trust with Guarantees 

Offering a guarantee alleviates any concern that the product will be defective or the service won't be right for them. Don’t [make a promise](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2014/07/sales-mastery-10-keys-to-building-trust-and-credibility-with-your-customers-cso-gp.html) you can’t keep or offer a benefit your product cannot deliver. Otherwise, your refund rate will be high.

Longer guarantees lower the likelihood your customers will return the product and ask for a refund. Many companies offer a 30 day guarantee, but offering a 60 day or longer guarantee dramatically lowers refund rates. Major retailers such as Lands End, Eddie Bauer and Costco offer unconditional return guarantees.



### 8. Create Magic Moments 

Magic moments occur when the customer is amazed by how you or your company exceeded their expectations. For example, my water heater stopped working about 2 weeks ago. I called my landlord, and she had a technician examine and replace it in under an hour! 

Another example: when Wistia was promoting creating videos with the GoPro, they sent a customer a camera for free. This created a lot of buzz, and it also created a satisfied customer who would share their story and advocate for the brand.

If you build trust, you'll gain more customers with less effort and retain their loyalty. Building trust isn't just about increasing your profits and expanding your business. Building trust is an important value for your organization because you want to serve your customers and help them improve their lives.
