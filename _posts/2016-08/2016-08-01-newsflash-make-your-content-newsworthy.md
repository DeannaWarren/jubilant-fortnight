Picture this: You’ve just gotten comfortable in your favorite armchair to watch the latest episode of your favorite TV show…And then the commercials come on. What do you do next?

You most likely change the channel, or you mute the TV and wait. You’re not watching the commercials because you KNOW you’re being advertised to.
As marketers, we often face the same problem: our readers don’t read our websites, don’t click on our PPC ads, and don’t opt in to our e-newsletters because they know they’re being advertised to.
Is there a way to promote your brand without being pushy AND also gain some free media coverage? 

### Are You Ignoring a Surprising Marketing Technique? Story at 11…

The technique is called “newsjacking,” by some. You may not have realized that companies use newsworthy content to inform you about their products and services. They’re doing so because they engage more readers with content that is also newsworthy. As more readers get their news from social media, they’re looking for newsworthy content to share with their followers. For example, 86% of users use Twitter for news, according to [Gerry Moran.](https://marketingthink.com/make-your-content-marketing-more-newsworthy/) 

Newsworthy content also generates more reader engagement, according to Chartbeat statistics discussed in this [Time article](http://time.com/12933/what-you-think-you-know-about-the-web-is-wrong/).

Newsworthy content, aka newsjacking, may also get your company more exposure. Since journalists need more content and sources for their news stories, you could end up mentioned in the [second paragraph](http://www.webinknow.com/2011/11/newsjacking.html) of the latest story.

How should you make your content newsworthy and get noticed by journalists? Here are 4 tips for getting started with newsjacking on your own blog:

### 1. Identify a Newsworthy Story

[Tom Shearman](http://www.digitalthirdcoast.net/blog/values-content-newsworthy) identified these elements of newsworthy stories:

* Timeliness: Publishing a story about breaking events soon after they happen makes your story timely. If you were to publish a story about the Democratic National Convention, it would be fairly timely, as it concluded last week. But, if you publish the same piece a month from now, that wouldn’t attract readers, as they will have already read that information from other sources.

* Significance: Publishing a story that is relevant for your readers will grab their attention and keep them reading. Readers want to know how a story impacts them right away, and they may not be willing to read longform content unless there is a clear benefit. Communicating the significance requires some knowledge of your audience demographics and psychographics.

* Authority: Your reader wants to know if you or your client are credible sources of information. For example, in [this press release for Specialists on Call](http://www.pressreleaserocket.net/specialists-on-call-inc-announces-its-50000th-psychiatry-patient-consultation/473928/), the Chief Medical Officer is quoted because he is a credible source of information about his company.

* The Bizarre: We are naturally intrigued by stories that sound unusual or unbelievable. Consider this headline: “On Demand Veterinarian Start Up Brings Telemedicine to Pets.” Believe it or not, that’s a [real headline](http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/startups/2016/07/on-demand-veterinarian-startup-brings-telemedicine.html). And here’s another example from the news this May: “Louie Gohmert: No Gay Space Colonies,” referring to [a congressional speech](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/louie-gohmert-no-gay-space-colonies) where he cited The Martian as evidence against LGBT rights.

* Human Interest: A human interest story helps you put a personal angle on a hot topic or current event. This [video clip](http://www.wearecentralpa.com/news/when-your-child-needs-a-medical-expert) uses human interest by giving a personal example of how a doctor helps children through telemedicine.

* Conflict: Discussing different sides of an issue will interest your readers. Examples abound from the current election season, BREXIT, and Russia’s Olympics doping scandal.

While your article won’t include all these elements, including some of them in your blog post, trade journal article, or press release will help create your own newsworthy content. 

### 2. Pick a Unique Angle 

To create newsworthy content, you need to provide insight on the story no one else has offered. You also must discover which audience will be interested in your content and [target them](http://www.toprankblog.com/2013/04/online-pr-company-news/). An angle also helps you [define the scope of your article](http://www.writersdigest.com/writing-articles/by-writing-goal/improve-my-writing/find-an-angle-to-bring-your-subject-to-life). Consider the most unique details of the events and [tell your story](http://www.jonathancrossfield.com/blog/2016/01/whats-your-angle-crafting-unique-content-ideas.html) in a unique way that relates to the topic.

### 3.  Publish While the Story is Still Relevant

If you want to gain attention with your newsworthy content, you need to publish while the news story is top of mind. According to [data from Parse.ly](https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-428528484/your-story-s-life-span-how-long-do-articles-really), articles have a median lifespan of 2.6 days, and traffic generally drops the day after publication. If you provide a commentary with several insights or a full report of all sides of the news story, then you may have more flexibility to post a few days after the story broke.

### 4. Create Your Own News Story

Instead of re-purposing a current event for an article on your website, consider sharing company news or new informative content. For example, [Miranda Miller suggested](http://www.toprankblog.com/2013/04/online-pr-company-news/) survey results, research findings, and statistics from customer data can offer interesting information to share in an article, press release, or social media post.

[John Jantsch](http://www.marcommwise.com/article.phtml?id=864) indicated that companies who are first to market with a new product gain media attention, as well. Showcasing your success and identifying a trend can also get you published in trade and industry publications. Finally, stories about the [background of your founder,](http://blog.pressfriendly.com/choosing-an-angle-for-your-story/) CEO, or other managers can become compelling stories.
