After 4 weeks of blogging, I’m looking for ways to drive more traffic to my website. If you’re starting a new blog, as I am, a roundup post is a good way to get started. As I consider writing a roundup post, I thought I’d share advice on how to do your own.

### What Is a Roundup Post?

A roundup blog post is a post where you collect a list of multiple resources and share them in an organized way. Roundup posts come in two flavors:

* Resource Roundup: AKA a curated roundup, where you share a list of helpful content resources such as articles, tools, e-books, or statistics, which are all related to a particular topic. For example, you could post a roundup of industry news or a list of industry blogs such as [this list of healthcare blogs from eVisit](https://evisit.com/top-100-healthcare-blogs-2016-edition/).

*Expert Roundup: You poll a list of experts on a particular topic and present their responses. [GoodTherapy’s roundup](http://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/topic-expert-roundup-are-social-media-bad-for-mental-health-0709135) on social media and mental health polls 17 experts.
* Opinion roundup: You list quotes and opinions from around the web related to your topic. For example, [this concierge medical practice advice roundup](https://evisit.com/the-new-medical-practice-checklist-expert-advice-roundup/) pulls quotes from journals and news sites. 

### Why Should You Do a Roundup Post?

Roundup posts generate more social shares and comments as your contributors will helpfully share your post with their followers. As their audiences begin following you, you’ll also gain increased targeted traffic to your website, increase newsletter opt-in rates, and potentially improve your search engine ranking with backlinks. Expert roundups also raise your perceived authority, as you’ll now be associated with these influencers. You’ll benefit from relationships you build with influencers in your niche and other bloggers. Plus, you’ll have high-quality blog content.

### How Do You Define Your Topic?

Once you’ve decided the type of roundup post (resource or expert), you need to pick a topic. In order to generate a list of topics to choose from, you can:

* Create a list of burning questions or problems in your industry
* Consider products in your niche and problems they solve
* Use Google Alerts to find popular topics from industry news
* Monitor hot topics in LinkedIn industry groups
* Use content curation tools

Choose a question that is relevant to your audience and complex enough to get a variety of responses from experts. For a resource roundup, you’ll need to choose a topic that is covered by multiple authoritative sources online. Find an interesting angle on your topic, especially if a roundup has been published on this topic already.

### How Do You Find Expert Contributors?

Once you’ve chosen your topic and written your question, assuming you’ve chosen the expert roundup, you need to find at least 20 influencers to include in your expert blog post. If you’re not well connected with your industry, (or even if you are), you’ll need to create a long list of experts who will be interested in answering your question. You also could consider looking outside your niche. Here are some ideas:

* Research other roundups in your niche and list their contributors
* Use tools such as [FollowerWonk](https://moz.com/followerwonk/) and [Triberr](http://triberr.com/) to find contributors on social media
* Search forums such as [Quora](https://www.quora.com/) 
* Contact podcasters and their interviewees

Before you contact them, ensure they they have a large social following and they are an authority. Also see if they’ve contributed to other roundups on your topic or if they have been interviewed on the topic recently.


### How Do You Get Responses?

Once you have a list of influencers for your expert roundup, you’ll need to ask them to contribute. Before you do, consider providing them value before contacting them cold. To provide value, you might follow them on social media, comment on their blog, or share their content. 

Once you’ve begun a relationship, you can contact them with your question through email or social media. Your message should:

1. Let them know why you’re contacting them
2. Show you read their bio and blog
3. Indicate why you think they are a good fit
4. State the question
5. Give them a deadline (10 days is recommended)
6. Let them know their response will be published.

[Brian Lang’s post](https://smartblogger.com/expert-roundup/) includes a helpful email template. 

When contacting influencers, be respectful of their time and make sure your question is easy to answer.

### How do I Manage Responses Without Getting Overwhelmed?

As you receive responses to your expert roundup question, you’ll want to organize the process by:

* Saving contact information and tracking responses in a spreadsheet or CRM
* Storing all responses in a single document
* Writing thank you, reminder, and announcement email templates and following up

This may sound like a lot of work, but staying organized and following up will help you gather more responses.

### How Do I Structure My Roundup Post?

Most readers won’t read your whole post, so you need to structure it in an organized way that is easy to skim. Here are quick tips on writing the 6 elements of your post:

* Headline: Tell the reader that you’re answering a problem. For expert roundups, include “experts,” “gurus” or “pros” to indicate that the content is from big names in your industry. For a curated roundup, include the number of resources, the content type, and creatively mention the topic.
* Header image: Create a collage of headshots of each expert in the article. This unique image will stand out on social media.
* Intro: Describe the problem and explain why the article is useful. You can also include a brief summary of the responses, depending on your article’s length. Offer a statistic or share the most interesting answer to entice the visitor to read on.
* Categories: For longer posts, you may want to break up the expert answers into categories and include a table of contents. If your experts are in multiple niches, you could categorize them by niche and include sub-headings. If there are conflicting viewpoints, categorize responses into camps such as for and against.
* Expert answers: Include the expert’s name, picture, website or social media profiles, and bio with each answer. Answers should be in their own font to be easy to scan. Consider including a Tweet button with each answer so it’s easy to share.
* Conclusion: Summarize the interesting findings from the roundup and leave the audience with something new.
* Call to action: invite the audience to read another article or opt in for your newsletter.

If you’re writing a resource roundup, you can follow the above outline and include different content and a relevant header image.

### How Do You Promote Your Roundup Post?

Once you’ve completed your roundup post, you’ll want to email your contributors or authors and announce that you’ve published. For expert roundups, send them the link with a thank you email, and offer to help them as well. 

While you hope that your contributors will share the post with their followers, you may not want to rely solely upon their generosity. To promote the content as much as possible, you could share the post as a press release, use the content to start discussions in forums, and target fringe social networks like Reddit and inbound.org. You might also inquire if other marketers would share the post with their subscriber lists. You could also consider promoting it with social ads or an AdWords campaign.
