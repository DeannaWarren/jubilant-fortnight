With [over 809,000](https://www.statista.com/topics/1244/physicians/) active primary care doctors in the U.S. alone, there is a growing market for telemedicine companies. However, in order to reach physicians, you'll need to target your marketing and include the right messages. To find those messages, consider the problems faced by small practice owners.

### Choosing the Right Message for Small Practices 

According to [the AMA](
http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/news/news/2015/2015-07-08-majority-americas-physicians-work-small-practices.page), 60.7% of physicians work in practices of 10 or fewer doctors. Since small businesses [have fewer resources,](http://findaccountingsoftware.com/expert-advice/15-experts-share-their-best-practices-for-marketing-to-small-businesses/) your messaging should focus on saving time, saving money, and promoting sustainability. 

A majority of physicians own their practices as well. That means you'll work hard convincing them to spend money, as they'll want to know how investing in telemedicine effects their business as a whole.

### Resistance to Adopting New Technology

Small practices may have greater resistance to adopting new technology, as well. You'll need to offer proven solutions that get results. Small businesses don't have time to take risks or experiment. You can prove your solution gets results with white papers and case studies.

### Prove You'll Add Value

If possible, position yourself as a small business facing similar challenges and highlight similarities. Small business owners want to know that you'll be there to help them get started using your cloud conferencing apps, remote monitoring products or services. They want to know that when they have technical difficulties, there is someone they can call for support. In other words, you must give added value beyond the product or service you offer.

### How to Reach Small Practices Online

Once you've determined the right messaging, you'll need to pick the appropriate communication channels for targeting physicians and small practices. As small business owners can spend [1-2 months](https://www.cebglobal.com/blogs/marketing-to-small-business-the-purchase-process-is-longer-than-you-think/) researching solutions online prior to purchasing, your website is a crucial resource to help clients find you. It must answer customer questions and prove your expertise.
To make your online marketing successful, consider including:

* Landing pages targeting specific audiences
* Case studies demonstrating effectiveness
* Testimonials and reviews
* Product demos and free trials for services
* Social media promoting your content

### Create Enthusiasm With Content Marketing

Content marketing is still an extremely successful way to build enthusiasm around your services and generate leads. If you provide information on topics of interests to physicians, they will find your content and show interest in you.

Also consider how you'll stay in contact with physicians, such as through email campaigns or e-newsletters. Continued communication helps you educate physicians about using your telemedicine platform. Plus, adding value helps build relationships and leads to [loyal customers](https://www.ducttapemarketing.com/blog/5-things-you-must-do-to-sell-to-a-small-business-owner/).

### Taking Your Online Marketing Offline

In person meetings are also excellent marketing opportunities. Conference presentations and live webinars are also excellent options many telemedicine companies are already taking advantage of.
