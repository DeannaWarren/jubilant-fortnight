Is your healthcare IT service or product new, expensive, or complicated?

If you're interested in capturing leads for your business, then offering a white paper will be a smart move for you.

#### What Is a White Paper, Exactly?

There are many right answers to that question, and there is some debate. A white paper should be a authoritative, detailed report on a single topic. Its goal is to promote a product or service to its readers. It usually presents a significant business problem and offers a solution. A white paper is educational in nature, so please leave your sales pitch at home.


### Who Reads White Papers?

Businesspeople read white papers when they're seeking detailed information about an important topic or critical problem. They're also interested in learning information from trusted industry experts. Writing a white paper is worth the effort, as it creates a valuable resource for your potential clients and helps build credibility with your audience.

White papers can be written for prospects at any point of the buying cycle. Ideally, your white paper will provide needed information and help your prospects make the decision to buy from you.

But white papers aren't just written for your prospects: in addition to attracting leads, they can also be shared with journalists in press kits, repurposed as articles in trade journals, or published in blogs on your website.

### How Long Should a White Paper Be?

While a white paper can be any length from 2 to 100 pages, you need to strike the right balance. If it's too short, it won't give enough detailed information to persuade the reader. Too long, and you'll lose the reader's interest. The generally accepted length is 6-8 pages.


### Why Are White Papers So Dense?

A white paper is much denser than an e-book, as it relies upon cited research, statistics and quotes to prove its position. White papers are written in a serious, professional style. While this makes white papers harder to read in a single sitting, it ensures you provide lots of valuable information. If your white paper is written and edited well, it will maintain their interest to the end.


### How Is a White Paper Organized?

The structure of the white paper is very important. Your white paper should include:

* Title page
* Table of contents
* Executive summary
* Introduction
* Main body
* Conclusion

### Is a White Paper All About the Text?

No. Your white paper isn't just about facts and figures. While it shouldn't look like a flashing neon sign, you'll want some color to catch your reader's eye. Illustrations and charts will help them understand the material. You'll most likely need a graphic designer to determine the layout, fonts, colors and images to make your white paper visually appealing.

### Types of White Papers

[Gordon Graham](https://www.thatwhitepaperguy.com/white-paper-faq-frequently-asked-questions/#what_is) classifies white papers into 3 broad categories:

1. Backgrounders: Provide descriptions of the features and benefits of a product or service. Backgrounders target prospects at the end of the buying cycle.
2. Roundups: A list of industry highlights on a particular issue.
3. Problem/Solution: Present an important problem and recommend a solution. They target prospects who are early in the buying cycle and researching problems.
