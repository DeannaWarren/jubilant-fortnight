Telemedicine is unknown to many who haven't seen a doctor online before. This makes marketing telemedicine challenging, unless you can target the right audience with the right message, using the right marketing channels. Millennials are an excellent audience for telemedicine. Why?

### Why Is Telemedicine Right for Millennials?

Millennials are [5 times more likely](http://www.medialogic.com/health-care-marketing/blog/telemedicine-millennials-key-others-health/) to experiment with new technology than any other age group. In fact, a report from [Salesforce](http://blogs.salesforce.com/company/2015/02/the-state-of-the-connected-patient-2015-infogrpahic.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter) indicates 71% of millennials want to book appointments via apps, and 60% want telehealth to eliminate in-person visits. 

Hard-working 20-year-olds and 30-year-olds are stressed out and have limited time in their busy schedules. They're looking for healthcare options that let them see the doctor without missing work. Millennials are also more conscious about healthcare costs, according to [USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/02/07/heres-how-millennials-could-change-health-care/79818756/).  

Millennials go to the doctor less frequently than older generations, and they don't feel the need to see the same physician every time. They expect convenience and don't want to schedule appointments weeks or months in advance. Millennial women with children especially [want online visits]https://blog.sprucehealth.com/millennials-want-doctors-use-telehealth-evidence/) they can schedule for late night emergencies.

### How to Reach Millennials Online? Go Beyond the Obvious

When establishing marketing objectives, consider which channels you can use to reach millennials. The obvious answer is social media, as over 90% of millennials use it to connect online, according to Pew Research Center. With [85% owning a smartphone,](http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2014/mobile-millennials-over-85-percent-of-generation-y-owns-smartphones.html) marketing through mobile apps and staying current with mobile search trends also makes sense.

Marketing to millennials isn't simple, though, as they won't be persuaded by shiny apps or Facebook ads on their own. [89%](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/connecting-with-millennial-shoppers/) consider friends and family more trustworthy sources for product recommendations than brands. Since [half of millennials](http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/hospital-management-administration/5-trends-in-healthcare-inspired-by-millennials.html) use reviews to select healthcare providers and insurance, ask current patients to review your telemedicine service. Additionally, provide information about insurance coverage.

Your marketing strategy will need to focus on multiple approaches including content marketing, email campaigns, social media, local SEO, influencer marketing and more. 

### Tailoring Your Content Strategy

Since many millennials are unaware of telemedicine's availability, your marketing needs to educate your potential customers. Your content can address topics of interest to millennials including ready access to healthcare, telemedicine's affordability, and conveniences of remote care. 

Your marketing also needs to address common concerns among millennials, such as privacy and data security. Millennials are worried about hacking and cybercrime. As data breaches become commonplace, you'll need to explain how you safeguard sensitive health information from hackers. 

### Demonstrating Thought Leadership to Employers

Another way to offer telemedicine to millennials is through their employers, since one-third of workers today are millennials. As more employers offer telemedicine to their millennial employees, you'll experience greater competition when marketing to employers. Positioning your company's leaders as subject matter experts on topics including software development, negotiating contracts with healthcare systems, and obtaining reimbursement for telemedicine will help you stand out. Employers also need assistance increasing utilization.

You can share thought leadership content on your company blog and feature it in your email newsletter. Also consider developing multiple content types, including:

* White papers 
* Webinars
* Slideshows
* Podcasts
* Videos
* Articles for industry publications

Publishing varied types of content regularly will help you reach out to employers and others who influence millennials. Millennials present a huge opportunity to telemedicine businesses who can market to them successfully.
