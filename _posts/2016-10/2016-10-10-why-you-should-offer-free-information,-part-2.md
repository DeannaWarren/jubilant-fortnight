Last week, I discussed why you will want to publish a lead magnet on your website. If you missed last week's post, [you can read it here.](http://www.copywritingforhealthcare.com/blogs/2016/10/03/why-you-should-offer-free-information.html)

Before I go on, perhaps you're skeptical about giving something away for free. You may be concerned readers will simply grab your giveaway and unsubscribe... Don't worry. If you provide the right lead magnet, they'll want to keep hearing from you.

Giving away information will help your potential customers trust you because they now know you're an expert. When they use the information or tools you've given them, they'll notice your solution wasn't just another gimmick--it actually got results.

Now, if you're interested in writing a lead magnet to attract new subscribers to your email list, where do you begin? 

### What Makes a Great Lead Magnet?

Just like you need the freshest ingredients when baking a cake, you'll want to include the right ingredients to make your lead magnet useful and easy to consume. Ensure you have the necessary [ingredients](https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/write-a-free-report-in-a-day-and-build-your-subscriber-list-for-years/?utm_expid=3606929-86.PHoDXYJeQYmWFQIujGOFZg.0) by:

1. Identifying a significant problem for your target audience
2. Focusing your lead magnet around one big idea
3. Demonstrating you researched the problem
4. Outlining the problem and its adverse effects
5. Explaining the benefits of solving the problem 
6. Offering all tools and resources needed to easily solve the problem
7. Answering common question and objections
8. Featuring an attention-grabbing headline
9. Including images and graphical elements

Including each of these elements helps you reach your goals: providing value and establishing a relationship with the reader. You'll need to invest time creating buyer personas, researching customer problems and ensuring your lead magnet looks professional, but the time investment is worthwhile.

### Choosing the Right Type of Lead Magnet

There are many options for the type of lead magnet you can offer. The format depends on the type of content you share, for example audio or video. Keep in mind your goal is to share information quickly, so your reader can act upon it immediately and move forward to the purchasing process. Common lead magnet formats include:

* Quick-start Guides, reports and white papers
* Case studies
* Cheatsheets and checklists 
* Resource lists
* Video training, such as demos  
* Free trials for apps
* Quizzes and surveys
* Assessments
* Sales materials
* Discount coupons
* Email series
* E-books
* Podcasts
* Slideshows
* Infographics
* Webinars
* Toolkits

So many options-- how do you choose the right option for your healthcare business?

### 3 Successful Lead Magnet Examples

Let's look at 4 examples of successful lead magnets: a toolkit, a white paper, a guide and a free trial.

### 1. Lifesize Toolkit  

First, Lifesize offers a [video conferencing toolkit](https://www.lifesize.com/en/ldp/telemedicine/usa?utm_medium=ppc&utm_source=g&utm_campaign=telemedicine&ls=content&ssd=white-paper&cid=70113000002DHQB&lgs=MG&utm_term=telemedicine&utm_campaign=Telemedicine-GGL-US-Exact&utm_adgroup=Telemedicine-Exact&utm_medium=ppc&utm_network=search&utm_source=g&utm_content=sipl4Y7oE%7Cpcrid%7C117386739278%7Cpkw%7Ctelemedicine%7Cpmt%7Ce%7Cpdv%7Cc%7C&mkwid=sipl4Y7oE%7Cpcrid%7C117386739278%7Cpkw%7Ctelemedicine%7Cpmt%7Ce%7Cpdv%7Cc%7C&muid=445300a4-cb4e-44b2-81c5-196328c32db6) when you subscribe to their email list, including reports, a case study, and a product comparison sheet. The report "5 Reasons Video Conferencing is Essential for Healthcare" quickly states the problems patients in rural areas face and positions video conferencing as the solution. 

The case study establishes trust in an expert interview format, using storytelling to bring the dry facts to life. Lifesize also makes calls to action on their landing page and thank-you page, offering a free trial.

### 2. AdvancedMD White Paper

AdvancedMD offers a white paper in exchange for your email address and phone number. The report, "How Telemedicine Can Transform Patient Engagement," clearly out lines the many benefits for medical practices and patients. They also offer a free consultation to help you sign up for their telemedicine service. 

### 3. TeleMental Health Institute Guide

TeleMental Health Institute offers a telehealth reimbursement guide for its [newsletter](http://telehealth.org/sign-up). This is a reference resource for mental health professionals seeking reimbursement for telehealth, and it proves TeleMental Health Institute's expertise in this area.
