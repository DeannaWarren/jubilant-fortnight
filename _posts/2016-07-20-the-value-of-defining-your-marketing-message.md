Why is defining your marketing message important? Your [marketing message](http://nonprofitanswerguide.org/faq/marketing-communications/how-are-key-messages-developed/) tells your customers what you do, how you help them and how you’re unique. Without a clear message, your prospects don’t know what you’re selling. Clarifying your marketing message helps you increase inbound traffic with a higher conversion rate. A clear message is also the foundation for producing high value content. 

I served as marketing chair for a Music Therapy conference, and I led a team of four volunteers. We were marketing our conference to vendors, selling ads in our conference iPhone app and booths in our exhibitor hall. I learned a great deal about marketing and leadership in a few short months. The most valuable lesson I learned was the importance of having a clear message that resonates with your prospects. Here is what I learned and how to develop that message:

1. Understand your product's value: When we were selling ads in the conference app, many of the schools or therapy businesses didn't know what value  they would receive by placing an ad in our conference app. When considering the product's benefit for the customer, ask questions such as:

* How does the product help them meet their goals?

* What problem does the product solve for the client?

* How does the product improve their life?

* What surprising benefits or results should customers be aware of?

Once you've answered these questions, you need to communicate those benefits to the customer.

2. Match sales funnel and buyer persona: While there were approximately 10 different product options for what type of ad the customer could buy, I found that we had one or two types of customers: universities and businesses. Universities and small businesses had different budgets and were buying different ads and packages. For example, smaller businesses were buying banner ads (ads that scrolled across the top of the phone screen) and full-page ads. Universities tended to purchase an package with a booth  and other options. 
When you're targeting a range of customers, it's helpful to develop [buyer personas.](http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-definition-under-100-sr#sm.00019svwerdxsfc211wvsmaf1m5nn) Buyer personas are developed through analyzing your customer data and making educated guesses about their needs. Your buyer personas should consist of:

* demographic information: geographic location, company type, industry, company size, and annual revenue.

* Contact person: contact person’s job title, responsibilities, who they report to, and how their job success is evaluated.

* Goals: The company and the contact person’s problems and challenges.

Buyer personas help you target different types of customers with personal messages. Once you've developed your buyer personas, consider which products and services will best meet their individual needs.

3. Deliver a consistent message: Effective marketing takes daily action and consistent follow-up. When you have multiple team members communicating with prospects, you need to make sure everyone communicates the [same message.](http://www.ourcommunity.com.au/marketing/marketing_article.jsp?articleId=1929)
 Writing a document with your marketing messages and benefits for your team members to reference will help keep your communications with prospects clear and consistent. 

4. Know the length of your buying cycle: We began marketing for this conference approximately 6 months before the conference weekend. We started making calls in October and had until the end February to close our prospects. Since many universities close for several weeks during the holidays, we sold fewer ads in December than other months. However, we sold the most ads in January and February because other customers had new budgets at the start of a new year. It's important to know your prospect's purchasing habits and help them plan ahead for the new year or an upcoming event. To determine the length of your [buying cycle](http://www.19oaks.com/blog/how-to-determine-the-length-of-your-sales-cycle), consider the length of time it takes to contact leads and the length of time between initial contact and purchase. Along with defining your marketing message, you should determine how often to contact your prospects and your marketing method.

5. Keep Lead Information Organized: Since we had multiple team members contacting leads, we also needed tools to stay organized. Match the tools to your organizational needs. Your organization will benefit from tools to help you share lead information, such as a spreadsheet or CRM software. Keeping a repository of lead and customer data also allows you to periodically review your buyer personas and to evaluate the effectiveness of your marketing message over time.
