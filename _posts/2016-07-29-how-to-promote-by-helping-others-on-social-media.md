Have you seen someone shamelessly over-promote themselves on social media? Sure, we all have unfollowed brands who post too frequently. And we all have friends that post [too many vacation photos](https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/2016/07/20/you-posting-your-vacation-photos-social-media-wrong/gL2Q9sZOQADSNaKp4npgKM/story.html), or who over-share too much personal information.

### What if you’re over-sharing…how would you know?

Here are some surprising statistics: When it comes to social media marketing, more isn’t better. According to [Jeff Bullas](http://www.jeffbullas.com/2012/02/29/10-powerful-tips-to-increase-fan-engagement-on-facebook/), posting twice per day yields 32% more likes and 73% more comments than 3+ posts per day on Facebook. [An ExactTarget survey](http://pages.exacttarget.com/SFF8-US?ls=Website&lss=Micro.SubscribersFansFollowersSocialBreakup&lssm=Corporate&camp=701A0000000NgyfIAC) showed 52% of Twitter users surveyed unfollow brands because they over-post uninteresting and repetitive content.

When it comes to marketing yourself or promoting your business online, how can you go about it respectfully, without being pushy, obnoxious over-sharers who flood news feeds and get ourselves un-followed?

We can market our businesses by being respectful of others online. What do I mean by being respectful? I mean behaving like each post or comment is a one-on-one conversation with someone you know who you want to think well of you. 

How do we go about being respectful online? Aside from the courtesies of any conversation, such as being kind to others, let's examine 11 ways to respectfully market yourself on social media:

### 1. Ask and Answer Questions 

Providing useful information in response to questions is a great way to engage people on social media. People appreciate answers to questions they don't have the answer to or don't have the time to seek out the answer to. It's also a great way to gain followers, as people now know that you're an expert they can turn to when they have questions on that subject. You can connect with people in your industry by joining groups and answering questions.

Asking questions is also an excellent way to increase user engagement. [Question posts](http://www.jeffbullas.com/2012/02/29/10-powerful-tips-to-increase-fan-engagement-on-facebook/) receive twice as many comments as other posts.

### 2. Share Articles and Add Your Opinion 

Whenever someone has a question, we often direct them to information on our website. Another option is to find articles that answer that question and share them with your audience. Don't stop there...take it one step further and add your own commentary or insights on that topic. Doing so shows that you're well-informed about that subject and you know how to deal with that situation. If you show that you can solve people's problems, then they'll get in touch with you and ask for your help.

### 3. Private Message Them With Further Information 

Sometimes it's prudent to have a conversation in a private message rather than on a public forum. Look out for the safety of the people you're communicating with. If they're sharing personal information on a public post, invite them to message you privately or to contact you via email. 

### 4. Follow Proactively 

Search out people in your industry you would like to connect with and reach out to them with a private message. Doing so creates a personal connection, rather than being an unknown person asking to connect. People are more likely to connect if they know what you have in common. 

If someone else follows you, follow them back. Send them a message thanking them for following you.

### 5. Give Recommendations

Recommendations on LinkedIn make other people look more authoritative and help them impress potential employers or clients. Give someone a recommendation or review before asking for one in return.

### 6. Include Helpful Links on Your Website 

Just like sharing links on social media, sharing helpful links on your website or blog creates good will with your readers. Visitors return often to the sites with the most useful information on a subject because they see those websites as the "one-stop shop" for the best insights on that topic. Linking to other sites also increases the search rank of your site and the other sites you link to. So, when readers Google your website's keywords, your site will show up higher on the search results page. You can also share these resources with your followers and let the author know you shared their link.

### 7. Like and Follow Your Readers  

When someone Likes your social media pages, Like them back. You'll increase their engagement with you. If someone likes or shares your posts, [thank them.](http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/27094/8-Guaranteed-Ways-to-Increase-Social-Media-Reach.aspx#sm.000176wmfr2nff92r1o1rkhn0e3xg) They’ll be more likely to engage with you in the future.

### 8. Mention Specific Names  

When you're posting a link to a useful article, include the name of the author in your post. If they're on Twitter, include their Twitter handle. Let them know you like their content and shared it with your readers.

### 9. Ask For Feedback  

Show that you care about what your audience thinks. Run polls, surveys and contests. Contests that ask people to subscribe or to share your social media page can be a great way to increase engagement.

### 10. Invite Followers to Interact Outside Social Media  

If someone likes what you share on social media, then they'll be interested in your newsletter, your Google Hangout or webinar. Interacting with you also puts people at ease because they know you're a real person. As [Jeff Fromm said in this Forbes article,](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jefffromm/2016/06/16/stop-measuring-reach-in-your-social-media-marketing-its-about-genuine-engagement/2/#3032099b61f4) “Today smart brands are embracing the idea of consumer discovery rather than marketing interruption.” Think about the last time you clicked on a banner ad…or the last time you saw a pop-up. Successful brands are turning to social media instead.

### 11. Respectfully Respond to Complaints

When customers come to you with a [complaint on social media,](http://www.seeksocialmedia.com/respond-negative-social-media-comments/) ignoring their concerns will negatively impact your reputation. Whenever possible, resolve your customer’s problem promptly. Simply acknowledging their criticism and communicating their feedback with your organization will often be sufficient. If you apologize for their difficulties and are sincerely interested in helping them, they’ll reward you and your brand by sharing their positive experiences with others.
