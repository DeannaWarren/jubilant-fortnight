Believe it or not, if you're not using emotions in your content marketing, you're making a HUGE mistake. Why?

Emotional messaging is important because it triggers your readers to share, according to [Martin Jones](https://www.coxblue.com/emotional-engagement-is-the-key-to-viral-content-marketing/). 

Would you like to have thousands of customers sharing your content? Absolutely! That's a major reason we publish content. But, getting content shared isn't as simple as adding an emotional appeal.

With only 2 seconds to grab your reader's attention, you must use emotions to entice them to start reading. Then, you need to provide a reason to read to the end. In other words, you have to make them CARE about what they're reading.


### Do Emotions REALLY Make a Difference in Content Marketing?

[Michael Brenner of Marketing Insider](https://marketinginsidergroup.com/strategy/marketing-is-personal-emotion-beats-promotion-by-2x/) said emotional marketing is twice as effective as selling based on functional value. An [IPA dataBank](http://www.ipa.co.uk/Page/IPA-Effectiveness-Advertising-Case-Studies#.UxUbPfRg5vk) study found 31% effectiveness for emotional campaigns vs. 16% for reason-based ones. Simply by adding the right emotions to your content, you could make twice as many sales.

[Jonah Berger and Katherine Milkman](https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&fileID=3461) proved emotions help content [go viral](http://www.jeffbullas.com/2015/08/19/tap-emotions-boost-content-marketing/). Pairing powerful emotions with interesting, useful content will increase your chances of success. 

But what if you don't have interesting information to share?


Using the right emotion makes your "boring" content more interesting. [John Rugh](http://relevance.com/the-power-of-emotion-in-content-marketing/) showed emotional marketing works in B2B as well. Buyers find companies who focus on their product alone [all look the same](http://b2bprblog.marxcommunications.com/b2bpr/emotional-content-marketing-why-you-should-make-readers-cry). The business buyer wants to purchase from a human being, not a corporation. Creating a personal connection is vital in B2B content because the customer completes [57% of the buying process](http://www.executiveboard.com/exbd/sales-service/the-end-of-solution-sales/index.page) before communicating with the vendor. 

The __biggest__ reason for emotional content: Without engaging content, the buyer won't be sold. 



### Choosing the Right Emotions to Use in Your Content

What emotions will entice visitors to share your content? Intense emotions help content go viral, such as:

* Positivity
* Happiness
* Surprise and amazement
* Fear and anxiety
* Anger 

While not technically an emotion, using humor also increases shares.



### When to Use Emotions for the Greatest Effect

Emotions should be used differently at each stage of the buyer's journey. If you use an inappropriate emotion at the wrong time, you may upset your buyer or lose their interest. If you're not familiar with the buyer's journey, you can [read a thorough explanation here](http://blog.hubspot.com/sales/what-is-the-buyers-journey#sm.0000tbplmnk3scsa11odpc1nhkos0). The buyer's journey consists of 3 stages:

1. Awareness: The buyer identifies a problem and gathers information.
2. Consideration: The buyer investigates potential solutions to the problem and compares options.
3. Decision: The buyer determines your product is the right solution and makes a purchase.

Let's examine how to use emotion in content during each stage of the buyer's journey.

### The Awareness Stage 

In the awareness stage, you aim to help the buyer understand their problem. Using storytelling and examples, you can paint a picture of the severity of the problem. You can also point out what problem she is currently tolerating that you can solve. Since the emphasis is on the problem, avoid discussing your product. Emotions to use at this stage include:

* Empathy: Show the reader you feel her pain and want to help.
* Anxiety: Illustrate the unpleasant consequences she should worry about if her problem remains unsolved.
* Hope: Give hope there is an answer to the problem.

For example, if you're selling skincare products, you might share an article on how to change her skincare daily routine so her skin glows.

### The Consideration Stage

In this stage, you solve the problem and begin showing how you provide the solution. You'll need to trigger emotional responses and also provide reasons your solution is superior.
Emotions include:

* Sadness: Using case studies, you reveal their pain, and then show how you solved the problem for someone like them.
* Safety: As customers consider alternatives, you must establish why they can trust your brand.
* Attraction: Appeal to their desire to become a part of a community.



### The Decision Stage

As the customer makes their purchasing decision, you establish safety and security. Many businesses use guarantees to reassure the customer they're not making a risky purchase. You'll also need to answer any objections and questions preventing them from purchasing. 

After the sale, maintaining a connection through content marketing will increase repeat sales. The emotions you'll use include:

* Authenticity: Show how you're like your customers. Demonstrate your desire to help them.
* Confidence: Prove you believe in the products and services you offer.
* Happiness: If you use testimonials or customer stories, they show ecstatic customers who are overjoyed by the benefits you provide.
* Incredulity: You might communicate a surprising benefit, or you might offer an incredible bonus as they make their decision.

Also, keep in mind that you'll be triggering two or more emotions within one piece of content. For example, you may cause anxiety about the reader's problems and then offer hope there is a solution. You'll also want to test whether the content evokes the expected emotions or if the reader has another undesired reaction.

Finally, be mindful of over-using strong emotions. When you misuse them, your readers will notice and will feel manipulated. Your goal is to foster trusting relationships, and tricking your readers will hurt your business. 

If you include the right emotions in content marketing at the right time, you'll gain more readers who share your content. You'll also gain a loyal following and build customer relationships that last.
