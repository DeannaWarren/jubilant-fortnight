In part 1 and 2, we discussed interviewing your client and writing a case study. To round out this series on case studies, let's consider how to promote them.

### Sharing Case Studies on Your Website


Should you share case studies on their own page, on your homepage, or both?

Many companies create a dedicated page for their case studies. If you have several case studies, organizing them in to [categories](http://www.webascender.com/Blog/ID/663/10-Effective-Uses-of-Case-Studies-for-Marketing-Software-Products#.WEIcTneZPF0), such as by industry, will help your prospects find what interests them. [Infusionsoft](https://www.infusionsoft.com/success-stories) intrigued its readers with snippets sharing statistics from the case study. You can use this technique to get your reader's interest, too.

Featuring them on your home page will make sure they are read. You can link to your case studies page or link to certain featured case studies. Including calls to action will also encourage your prospects to read.


### How Case Studies Can Help Your Landing Pages

Repurposing quotes from your case studies on landing pages will help convince your prospects to buy your products. These quotes should be short and focus on your customer's results. If you have high-profile clients, sharing their business logos or photos may increase click-through rates.

### Promoting Case Studies on Social Media

When sharing your case studies on social media, be sure to focus on your client, rather than talking about your own products. If you focus on the challenge your client faced, then your prospects can compare them with their own experiences. If they see similarities in their own businesses or their own lives, they'll be more likely to bring their business to you.

What else can you share on social media? In addition to the case study itself, sharing specific statistics, quotes, and charts are eye-catching. Sharing information you didn't include in your case study can also grab attention. Writing and sharing a [case study summary](https://blog.crazyegg.com/2016/04/27/create-case-study-wow-visitors/) to tell your followers what the case study is about may also generate interest.

Finally, be sure to tag the company or person you featured in your case study, as this adds credibility. Then, your prospects can learn more about them and reach out to them if they wish.

### More Ways to Promote Case Studies

Once you've made the effort to write an exceptional case study, it makes sense to share it with as many prospects as possible in as many ways as you can. Beyond sharing it on your website and social media, there are many ways you can promote your case studies. You can promote your case studies by sharing them with:

* Your Email List:  Many of your prospects are likely in the same industry as the client featured in your case study. Sharing your case study with this industry segment of your email list is an effective lead nurturing strategy.
* Sales Team: Your salespeople can feature case studies during product demos or include them in presentations. [HubSpot](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/case-studies-marketing#sm.0000dkshcha65ef2y0a18wqpngr9xSharing) also recommends sharing them during webinars and live presentations.
* E-books: Case studies can be expanded in e-books, as readers expect in-depth information. You can also include step-by-step instructions or templates for implementing a strategy featured in your case study.
* Blogs: You can repurpose the case study as a QandA post or share top tips. If your client uses your products in unique ways, your readers will be interested in hearing about them.
* Trade publications: If you share your case studies with [trade publications](http://kc-communications.com/9-ways-promote-repurpose-case-study/), they may include them in an article or write about the company from a unique angle. Make sure your client is willing to be interviewed by the media.
