As 2016 draws to a close and you plan your marketing objectives for 2017, you may want to evaluate your content marketing. With more and more businesses realizing the advantages of content marketing, there may be greater competition to reach your customers. You must determine if your content is achieving the results you want... 

### Is Your Content Meeting Your Audience's Needs?

To evaluate your content marketing, first consider whether your content itself meets your audience's needs. In [Digital Marketing Strategy,](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Marketing-Strategy-Integrated-Approach/dp/074947470X) Simon Kingsnorth tells us great content is: credible, shareable, useful, interesting, fun, relevant, different, and on brand. You can evaluate whether each content type or each individual piece of content is addressing each of these criteria.

### Is Anything Missing From Your Content Marketing Strategy?

When evaluating your overall content strategy, consider whether changing your approach will reach more customers. Some questions to consider include:

* Does your content marketing meet your business goals?
* Does your content adequately promote each of your products or services?
* Does your content effectively target a specific audience or subset of your audience?
* Is your competitor analysis complete and up-to-date?
* Does your content address each stage of the buying cycle (awareness, consideration, and decision)?
* Do you know where your customers spend their time online, such as social media? Is your content reaching your audience on those channels?
* Do you produce the types of content your audience likes to consume, such as long-form articles, infographics, or videos?

You may also consider whether your content creation processes can be streamlined with creative briefs, content calendars, and editing checklists. Implementing or changing these can improve organization and efficiency. 

### Understanding Why Content Failed

Unfortunately, not every piece of content you create will be a smashing success. As you review your content from the past quarter or year, use analytics to determine which content was least effective. This will provide clues for how you can improve your content creation and distribution. For example, if content wasn't shared on Facebook but it was shared on Twitter, then you can focus your efforts on Twitter and experiment with Facebook to improve your results.

When evaluating your content, make sure to track a variety of KPI's (Key Performance Indicator) such as:

* Social followers
* Number of impressions your content received
* Number and quality of [backlinks](http://www.smartinsights.com/content-management/content-marketing-strategy/measuring-content-marketing-kpis/) to your content
* Retweets and shares
* Satisfaction ratings
* Number of conversions and leads generated

The metrics you evaluate will depend on your specific business goals. Make sure you evaluate KPI's regularly, which helps you optimize your content over time.
