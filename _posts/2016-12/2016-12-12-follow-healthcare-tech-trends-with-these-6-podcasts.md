Keeping up on healthcare tech news is time-consuming. Rather than spending precious time reading dozens--or even hundreds-- of articles, why not listen to it instead? 

You can keep up with the latest healthcare technology trends by listening to these podcasts:

### 1. Tech Tonics

[Tech Tonics](http://venturevalkyrie.com/the-tech-tonics-podcast/) is "bringing to life the people and passion at the intersection of technology and healthcare." As leaders themselves, hosts David Shaywitz and Lisa Suennen lead thought-provoking conversations with international healthcare IT leaders. They discuss topics including digital health, wearables, precision medicine, healthcare apps, telehealth, space medicine, citizen science, and a whole lot more. Episodes air twice a month.

### 2. The Healthcare Information Security Podcast

The [Healthcare Information Security Podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/healthcare-information-security/id504642987?mt=2) has produced over 300 episodes so far. Recent episodes feature leaders Justin Dolly from Malwarebytes, Brooke Satti Charles from IBM Security, and more. Each news report-style episode packs several stories into a 10 minute podcast.

### 3. Modern Healthcare Executive Series 

[Modern Healthcare Magazine](http://www.modernhealthcare.com/section/MH_podcasts) produces interviews with healthcare executives twice a month. Notable recent guests include Dr. John Noseworthy, Mayo Clinic's CEO, and Dr. Richard Gilfillan, CEO of Trinity Health. Episodes are available on their website but aren't listed on iTunes.
