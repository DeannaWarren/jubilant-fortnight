If you're not humanizing your brand, you're missing an opportunity to connect with your audience. Why? Humanizing your brand leads to transparent and honest relationships. Customers know when you're not being genuine, and they can wreck your reputation in just a few tweets. So, humanizing your company is vital to keeping pace with your competition. 

Here are 6 approaches to humanizing your brand:

### 1. Talk With a Personal Voice

Your customers want personal interaction. Look at Coca-Cola's Twitter feed, and you'll see they talk in a friendly, relaxed tone. You can talk genuinely by ditching the industry jargon and using simple language everyone can understand.

Influencers also help develop your personal voice. For example, Hines Ward of the Pittsburg Steelers helped turn Built With Chocolate Milk into a popular fitness drink. Influencers create content your audience actually wants to consume, gaining more followers and shares as well. [Jay Block recommends](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/successful-marketing-letting-others-tell-your-story-jay-block) encouraging creativity with content influencers produce, rather than forcing them to incorporate your messaging. While building relationships and educating them about your brand will take time, the connection they build with your audience is a worthwhile investment.

### 2. Humanize Yourself by Sharing Personal Stories

Telling stories helps you form a personal connection with your audience. [Margot da Cunha of Search Engine Journal](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/7-ways-humanize-brand/139320/) recommends sharing stories about overcoming failure. Your About page might tell how your founder overcame challenges to start a successful company. Also share how you helped a client overcome obstacles to achieve success.

Telling stories helps humanize you by evoking emotions. When you [inspire your readers](http://www.pammarketingnut.com/2013/02/talk-human-to-me-20-tips-to-humanize-your-brand/) to achieve more, they'll be more likely to share your brand and become advocates.

### 3. Share Personal Photos and Faces

Photos show the real human beings behind the product. Photos also [build trust](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/7-ways-humanize-brand/139320/) because they're memorable and easy to relate to. 

Who should you feature in your photos? 

* Staff: Encourage your employees to share about your company online. You can also create an Instagram hashtag for company photos.
* Writers: If you have a staff member, freelancer or guest author writing your content, sharing their photo adds credibility. 
* Executives: When you publish company updates or press releases, have your executives share the news. When they engage with customers and share branded content as part of their personal brand, you'll gain more leads. 
* Community Managers: If you want a thriving online community, you'll need someone to manage it. Sharing your community manager's photo and personal social media accounts allows its members to ask questions.

### 4. Engage in Personal Conversations 

Whether over social media or at trade shows, engage your audience in one-on-one conversations. Asking questions starts conversations and invites responses. 

On social media, thank your readers for answering your questions or sharing your content. Being active on multiple platforms makes it easy to engage with you. Focus on the sites your audience visits frequently. [Jason Demers](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jaysondemers/2016/03/31/5-ways-to-humanize-your-brand/#6f6acd511fa2) suggests responding to comments on other sites and profiles you donâ€™t control, which shows you're listening and ready to help. 

Take every opportunity to personalize your communication. When you sign in to many websites, you now see a welcome message including your name. When a customer signs up for your email list, you can send them a personal welcome email or offer a special discount on products they're interested in. 

### 5. Humanize With Humor

People like to share anything they find funny. Step back now and then and feel free to make fun of yourself. Tongue-in-cheek humor also works well. For instance, Allstate invents hilarious disasters and then reassures its customers they'll be insured.

### 6. Be Yourself, and Be Genuine

The more genuine your company appears, the more successful you'll be. Showing how you're like your customers builds trust. You can share your employee's tweets, which communicates interests and values your staff and customers likely share. Your company can also prove your commitment to the community by [supporting causes you believe in](https://moz.com/blog/4-ways-to-build-trust-and-humanize-your-brand).
