In 2014, Airbnb began publishing Pineapple, a print magazine. To help customers view Airbnb as a lifestyle experience, they decided to improve their offline marketing. They distributed thousands of copies to Airbnb hosts worldwide.

Then, they hired a marketing director who wasn't sold on the project. He [slashed the budget](http://www.wsj.com/articles/heres-what-happened-to-pineapple-airbnbs-one-off-print-magazine-1449684006). By crafting a plan and getting executives to buy in from the beginning, Pineapple could have reached its second issue and achieved Airbnb's original goals.

You can avoid a similar experience by crafting a solid content marketing strategy.

### Why Do You Need a Content Marketing Strategy?

Before you tackle a new adventure, what do you need? Before packing your suitcase, you plan your trip with a map. A documented content marketing strategy is the map you need to succeed. 

Just like traveling with a map, having a content marketing strategy helps you keep on track. According to the [Content Marketing Institute](http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/developing-a-strategy/), if you have a content marketing strategy:
* You will feel more effective at content marketing
* Content marketing will feel less challenging 
* You'll feel more confident using all content marketing tactics 
* You'll be able to justify spending more of your budget on content marketing

Content Marketing Institute's [research](http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/research/) found only 35% of B2B marketers have documented their content marketing strategy. So, you have a unique opportunity to gain an advantage over your competition.  

### Developing Your Content Marketing Strategy in 5 Steps

In [Content Marketing Strategies for Dummies](https://www.amazon.com/Content-Marketing-Strategies-Dummies-Stephanie/dp/1119154545), Stephanie Diamond divides your content marketing strategy into 5 steps:

1. Company Focus
2. Customer Experience
3. Content Creation
4. Channel Promotion
5. Check-back Analysis

Let's examine each step in detail...

### 1. Company Focus 

To distinguish yourself from your competitors, your team must decide how content marketing will meet your business goals. Your goals will include gaining attention for your company, gaining new customers and maintaining loyalty among recurring clients.

Content Marketing Institute urges teams to outline: 

* Reasons why you're developing content 
* Potential risks of content marketing 
* Your vision for success 

By addressing these concerns and goals, you have a concrete plan to present to executives and shape future benchmarks as your company grows. 

An example of this is a innovative solution by the New York Times. As most people know, print media is struggling to remain relevant in a world saturated with immediately available information. To remain relevant, they turned to the newly avalible [Google Cardboard](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/) and developed an app, [NYTVR](https://www.nytimes.com/marketing/nytvr/index.html). By combining the new exciting tech, the affordability of the Cardboard, and their exclusive content, they created a unique and appealing experience. Recognizing that they must take advantage of new tech, the New York Times assured they will remain relevant and, more importantly, stay in business while adapting to a new technological age.  

### 2. Customer Experience 

With 27 million pieces of content shared [every day]((http://www.slideshare.net/NewsCred/50-best-stats-presentation?ref=http://localvox.com/content-marketing-is-the-secret-to-local-marketing-success/)), why should your customers care about you? You need to know who they are to answer that question.
 You will need to survey your audience and collect available data to develop buyer personas. This helps determine your ideal customers and tailor the buyer's journey to maximize conversions.

[82% of customers](http://www.demandmetric.com/content/content-marketing-infographic) feel more positive about a company after reading content relating to their interests. Whole Foods aims to encourage customers to embrace a healthy lifestyle by providing helpful articles about healthy eating and saving money. Their content encourages new visitors to become customers by being inclusive and giving their audience useful information. 

### 3. Content Creation 

The next step is to determine if the content you already have fits your new strategy. Moving forward, focus on creating valuable content your customers want to consume. You must decide: 

* How you'll create valuable content 
* The types of content you'll create
* Who is responsible for creating it 
* Your content publishing schedule 
* Your main topics 

Choosing the right messaging and ideas to communicate will set you apart from your competition. You also need to create a workflow and define responsibilities for team members to reduce confusion and conflicting messages. 

One way to ensure you produce content your customers want to consume is to include your audience in the creative process. Random House shares a wide variety of content that inspires its team members and encourages input from their audience.

### 4. Channel Promotion 

Deciding which channels to use is very important. You need to determine where the content will be published, which can influence the type and format of content. You must also decide who will distribute content to the different channels. Make sure your customers can find content easily and share it.

You need a plan for each specific channel to make sure content gets shared widely. It can be vital to consider paid advertising, syndication and guest posting. Find influencers in the groups representing your buyer personas and work with them to grow your brand even more effectively. 

It is important to gauge the language your audience will appreciate. What works for one company will be completely inappropriate in other situations. 

On one hand, Nike uses Twitter to provide support to its customers. Looking at [@NikeSupport](https://twitter.com/nikesupport), they respond quickly, helpfully and respectfully. They specialize in interactive, fun, and playful communication. 

On the other hand, Rolex uses social media to share beautiful photos and videos. Always sleek, they maintain the elegant and classy personality associated with the brand. Although they could have fun and playful communication, it would clash with their established branding. 

To take the extreme, Denny's uses Tumblr and Instagram to share funny and weird social content like this: ["Our pancakes are sophisticated. Very sophisticated. And deliciousâ€¦definitely delicious."](http://blog.dennys.com/post/150057117178/our-pancakes-are-sophisticated-very) This is used to describe a stack of pancakes, smoking a pipe, reading a book. This bizzarre and funny content results in a wide spread of their content and a positive reaction to their brand. By appealing to and embracing people's sense of whimsy, Denny's creates their own strong and positive branding.

### 5. Check-back Analysis 

Of course, ensuring all your effort leads to positive results is a must. Choose evaluation metrics and measure success regularly. Make revisions and reassess your plan if it isn't working. 

Your mission and business goals should remain the same, while content topics, channel plans and content creation workflows should be revised regularly. This maintains fresh, relatable content and continues the growth created by your content marketing strategy.
