Does unethical marketing work? No. [Unethical marketing](http://whitehatcrew.com/blog/how-do-customers-decide-to-buy/) isn't the way to go, and not just because you'll land your company in hot water. It fails because it simply doesn't work. Your customers will get angry when your product doesn't deliver and they'll return it. They'll complain when they discover hidden fees. And your reputation, and ultimately your profits, will suffer.

Take, for example, Airborne, who claimed their herbal supplement prevented common colds. Their false claims resulted in a huge scandal and a $30 million settlement.

When your marketing efforts are floundering, it may be tempting to turn to unethical marketing. Instead, let's consider how to identify and solve marketing problems.

If your customers are running away instead of buying from you, you may be having trouble answering one of these four objections:

1. Can I trust you?
2. Will your products deliver as promised? 
3. Should I take a risk and buy from you?
4. Is the huge reward worth the risk in buying your product?

There are many problems to solve and pitfalls to overcome as you market your business. Your job is to foresee your customer's objections and answer them before you lose the sale.

### Building Trusting Relationships With Your Prospects

You can't take each and every customer out for a day on the ropes course. In fact, you often won't even talk to them before they purchase. To build trusting relationships online, you'll want to build your message around your [customer's needs.](http://www.businessknowhow.com/marketing/reasonsbuy.htm) If you're passionate about solving their problems, your customers will bring you their business. You can show your passion by:

* Using your About page to show how you're like your customers
* Being helpful and courteous in your communication through email and social media
* Telling engaging stories in a personal voice

You can read my post on [humanizing your brand](http://www.copywritingforhealthcare.com/blogs/2016/09/05/humanizing-your-brand.html) for more ways to share your passion.

You'll also want to reduce the number of choices your customer has to make. A study by [Sheena Iyengar](https://hbr.org/2006/06/more-isnt-always-better) showed customers are less likely to purchase when presented with too many options. In order to learn your customer's needs and how many options to give them, you need to conduct surveys and create buyer personas. When interviewing customers, [Kelly Robertson](http://www.businessknowhow.com/marketing/whybuy.htm) recommends asking what they are looking for in the product and why. 

### Prove Your Product Actually Works

Last year, I bought a used laptop online. I felt great about saving $700... Until two months later, when it wouldn't turn on. I felt foolish for making a bad purchase. Your customers are afraid of making a similar mistake, so you must prove your product does what you says it can.

When you first present your product, your product description can share the biggest benefits and address the [most common fears.](http://www.themogulmom.com/2011/02/customer-objections/) Customers have many questions about the product as well as the company behind it. A FAQ page can address these concerns.

You also want to show your customers you have [solutions to all of their problems.](https://www.thebalance.com/top-5-reasons-customers-aren-t-buying-from-you-2295720) You can remind them why they need your product through an informative blog or email newsletter. You might share how-to guides, tips and tricks, and maintenance instructions. When you provide useful information, you'll soothe away their fears and present yourself as a helpful resource. 

### Convincing Customers You Offer the Best Option

You already know there is an enormous sea of competition out there. Don't worry--as long as you provide a high-quality product and you have the desire to serve your customers, you're likely miles ahead of the competition. First, you'll want to help your buyers compare your product with similar available products and prove yours is the best choice. You can also prove your product's superiority by sharing:

* Video demonstrations showing ease of use
* Customer testimonials and success stories
* Case studies demonstrating real-world results
* Expert reviews proving high quality

Your goal is to show your company has solved your customer's problems before. You also want to communicate the quality of the experience they will have when they work with you.

### Showing the Rewards Are Worth the Risk

Once you've proven your product's superiority and your trustworthiness, the buyer has to make several decisions. Should they buy your product today or tomorrow? Can they afford your price? If your product is difficult to use, do they have the time and knowledge to learn to use it? 

To help customers make the investment, you can offer a payment plan or sweeten the offer with a package deal. If they're concerned about the time investment, you can provide an expected timeline or offer to train them to use your product.  

Since you've educated them already, they should understand why they need your product. Nevertheless, they may still have doubts. You should consider a money-back guarantee to help them overcome their misgivings. If you can't offer a guarantee, you and your staff should be prepared to courteously help unsatisfied customers. You could provide a follow-up call, which demonstrates you're committed to your customer's satisfaction. Or, you may want to have a dedicated phone line, email address, chat box, or social media account where you can respond to customer questions quickly. 

If you adequately address your customer's concerns and are passionate about serving your customers, you won't need to use unethical marketing. You'll increase your business in the long run, as well.
