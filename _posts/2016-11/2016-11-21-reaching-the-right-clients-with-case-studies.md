Does your website encourage clients to sign up? Are the patients who book appointments the patients you're looking for?

If not, case studies can help you show who you serve and how you help them. Case studies are increasingly popular because they help to explain complex products and services that are hard to understand. 

### What Is a Case Study?

Case studies are stories about your company, your products and services. They are success stories told in an editorial style, similar to a magazine article. Note: For clarity, the term case study is also used in scientific research. In this article, I'm only discussing case studies for marketing purposes.

Case studies are also called application briefs, user stories, case histories, and use cases.

### What Makes a Case Study a Case Study?

A case study focuses on a single story from an individual, company or organization. They generally describe your customer's experience working with your company or using one of your products or services. 

Case studies are generally 2-4 pages long. They're often written in feature article format, making them easy to reprint in trade magazines. While they should include quotes from your clients, a case study is much more than an extended testimonial.

### What Are the 5 Elements of an Effective Case Study?

A case story is like a novel, with a beginning, middle and end. To be most effective, a case study should describe:

1. The customer or client
2. The problem the customer wants to solve
3. The customer's process of seeking and discovering the solution
4. The problem's resolution and the successful implementation of the solution
5. The specific results your client achieved

So what can you do to craft a case study that attracts patients to test your product or try your service?

### Select the Best Client for Your Case Study

In order to write a case study, you or your copywriter will interview your client. You'll want to ensure you choose the best client (or clients) for the case study. 

This person or company is likely already an advocate of your services. Since they were highly satisfied with what you offered them, they may also send other potential clients your way. Consider whether their story will help your audience better understand your products/services, as well. 

Keep in mind that the client doesn't have to tell a perfect story. It may actually help your audience trust you if they know your customer experienced some challenges with your product, which you then helped them solve. If you can, demonstrate how you went above and beyond to provide amazing service.

###  Ask the Right Questions During Your Interview

Before your interview, consider the questions to ask. Otherwise, you'll be scheduling follow-up interviews, costing time. While you prepare, gather any information you have on them or their company, such as responses to questionnaires, emails, or call notes from your CRM. The questions you ask will help you write each of the 5 elements of your case study, mentioned above. Important questions include:

* Can you give me a brief overview of your business?
* How long have you been using our product/service?
* What goals does our product help you accomplish?
* How specifically has our product impacted your business?
* What metrics does your company use to measure its success, and how has our product/service effected those metrics?
* What made you decide to use our product/service instead of our competitor's?
* How did you and your team implement our product/service?
* After using our product/service, what other changes have occurred in your business?
* How else has using our product effected your business?
* What are your plans to use additional products/services from our company?

### Ask Your Client for Everything You Need

In addition to their time and their answers to your questions, you'll need your client's approval after you write the case study. You'll also want to ask for their logo, your interviewee's photo, and photos of their team using your product. Build in time for your client's team to review and approve the case study, as they may ask for revisions.
