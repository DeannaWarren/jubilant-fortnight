With the holidays approaching, you're likely busier than ever. 

Between completing this year's marketing projects, analyzing your results, and planning goals for next year, your schedule is likely more stuffed than a Thanksgiving turkey. Content marketing may be at the bottom of the list. With the number of items on your to-do list, let's consider 5 ways you can save time on content marketing. That way you'll get more done before the new year.

### 1. Listen to Your Data for Content Marketing Objectives

As you establish marketing objectives for the next month, quarter, or year, analyze your data. Compare the strategies and campaigns that worked well with the ones that flopped. 

How does data analysis save you time? It ensures you select the right goals based on your data. It prevents you from accidentally choosing the wrong goals, which can waste a lot of time and effort.

If the data from your analytics is unclear or incomplete, you may also want to survey your audience. Discovering their challenges as well as the content they like to read will help set content marketing goals.

### 2. Repurpose Content to Cut Writing Time

If you're too busy to write new content around the holidays, no problem. You can repurpose your old blog posts, white papers, e-books, brochures, or any other type of content.

### 3. Creating Templates From Your Popular Content

Now that you've identified your audience's preferred content, you can use that content as a template. When you create content in future, you'll know your readers will appreciate the content. 

What content can you turn in to templates? 

You can use popular blog posts and emails with high response rates. You may also find it helpful to create instructional guides to walk others through a complex process.

### 4. Put Time-Saving Tools to Work

Writing content, promoting content, and social media promotion can take lots of time if not managed well. If you don't already, consider using social media scheduling tools such as Buffer and Hootsuite, as well as content management tools like Coschedule.

Implementing RSS and automated email notifications can speed up content promotion as well.

If you already have marketing automation software or another solution that works well, consider how you can optimize your workflows to increase efficiency.

### 5. Seek Assistance From Experts

As much as I would like to be an expert at every aspect of marketing, I recognize that I'm not an expert at graphic design. If you're like me, and don't have the time to become an expert at every aspect of marketing, you'll want to hire outside assistance. Whether you need help with design, SEO, social media, copywriting, or content marketing, you'll be able to hire experts who will help you get the job done quickly and professionally.
