Last week I discussed case studies and conducting case study interviews. In part 2, I'll discuss the writing and promotion process. But first, let's discuss what to do following the case study interview.

### Following Up After the Interview

In addition to sharing the final draft with your interviewee and their marketing team, share a link to the case study once you publish it and invite them to share it. 

Also, send a thank you letter to show your appreciation. Your customer may also appreciate if you offer [something extra]http://www.storiesthatsellguide.com/2015/10/are-you-leaving-the-icing-off-customer-case-studies/) in return for their time. You might showcase their best practices at industry conferences or provide networking opportunities.

### Follow Best Practices to Write Great Case Studies

Sometimes, it's great to try something new. But when you want winning content, you follow a formula. Part 1 stated the 5 sections to include in every case study: the customer, the problem, the selection process, the implementation, and the results. Most case studies include 2-3 short paragraphs for each of these 5 sections. 

Here are some additional tips for crafting your case study:

* Use a short title and feature the result your client achieved. Include numbers and specifics.
* Write an executive summary of 2-4 sentences about the individual or company featured. If the company has a bio, ask if they want you to include it.
* Incorporate supporting visuals, including photos, graphs, and charts.
* Include quotes from your customer that sum up the main message succinctly.
* Make your case study [easy to scan](http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33282/The-Ultimate-Guide-to-Creating-Compelling-Case-Studies.aspx#sm.01xdq0cu14fxe9511i62kuk53dadz) by including headings and bulleted lists.


### Changing Up the Case Study Format

What if a case study in written form just isn't right for your audience or your content? Maybe you already have several case studies in your arsenal and you would like to try something different...

Try a [different format](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/creating-a-great-case-study/). You can use an interview format instead, and share it as a podcast or video. 

### Follow Up to Learn Long-Term Benefits

After completing and publishing your case study, your relationship with this company isn't over. After all, they're still an important customer. They still have needs you must continue to meet. Since they've already gained publicity from being featured on your website and in your marketing materials, they'll be open to a continued relationship. You can take this opportunity to follow up with them in the coming months. You'll gain updated data about the results they achieved and learn more about how they use your products. You can then add to your case study or publish an update on your website.

### Promoting Your Case Study

Do you want your customers to read your case study once you write it? If so, the most important step is to make it easy to find on your website. Linking to it from your homepage increases the chance it will be read.

Other ways to promote your case studies include:

* Sharing them in LinkedIn [industry groups](http://www.storiesthatsellguide.com/store/tip-of-the-month/how-a-fast-growing-company-sells-with-the-voice-of-the-customer/) when someone asks a related question.
* Sharing on Facebook with a poll or survey.
* Featuring as part of an autoresponder sequence.
* Summarizing and repurposing for blog content.
* Sending printed copies directly to customers.
* Sharing with PR contacts and inviting them to reprint it as a industry magazine article.
