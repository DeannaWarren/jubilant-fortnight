"Could you give me some advice on marketing for introverts?"
I received this question from a therapist on Facebook, and I had to stop and think about my answer.

If you're like me, you prefer to leave the spotlight to others. While I'm not shy, I prefer to listen when I'm around others. I love having deep conversations with people one on one. I used to consider introversion as a weakness because I used to dislike speaking in front of large groups. As a therapist, leading groups is part of the job, and I’ve become extremely comfortable as a leader.

If you feel your introversion is preventing you from marketing successfully, then you’re missing opportunities to grow your business. Whether you’re a therapist with a private practice, or a large healthcare organization, marketing is a necessary component of getting clients and generating profits. The two challenges I’ve had to overcome are how to market authentically and how to avoid exhaustion and burnout. 

My introversion is actually  a strength, and you can also make introversion a strength, if you find the right approach for you. My first piece of advice to you is to recognize your strengths. If you discover how to play to your strengths in marketing, you'll focus your efforts and save yourself time. How can you take advantage of your introversion and become a better marketer? Here are 6 ideas:

### 1. Find Your Ideal Marketing Medium

Evaluate your strengths and find a marketing strategy that emphasizes them. If you're a good writer, then market yourself through blogs and guest posts on other blogs. If you're strong at one-on-one interactions, start a podcast and interview others. 

Conversely, [avoid the marketing methods](http://www.talentedladiesclub.com/all-help/three-effective-marketing-strategies-for-introverts/) that cause you stress. If public speaking or presenting in a Q&A webinar is terrifying or uncomfortable for you, avoid it as much as possible. Instead, as my business coach Joshua Boswell says, find one marketing approach that appeals to you that you will do every day. If you’re struggling to excel at a marketing approach that isn’t right for you, that causes stress and leads to burnout. 

### 2. Avoid Burnout Through Time Management

Manage your time effectively so you don't get burned out. Only market when you have the energy, and plan ahead for when you need a few days off from marketing. [Paul Jarvis recommends](https://pjrvs.com/a/introvert/) writing ahead of time and queuing newsletters, blog posts and social media updates. Create a content calendar and use automation tools like [Buffer](https://buffer.com/) for social media posting.

### 3. Spend Time With Others Selectively

It's important to be selective about your interactions. It can be hard to remember in the moment, but you don't have to respond to every comment on your blog or social media instantaneously. Let others know that you're not available during specific times and respect those boundaries yourself. For example, if you get your best work done in the mornings, let your calls go to voicemail and then return calls in the afternoon. In The Four Work Week, [Tim Ferris](http://fourhourworkweek.com) recommends checking your email no more than twice a day. Screen your calls and emails and choose the interactions that benefit you the most, then put your energy elsewhere.

### 4. Give Yourself Time to Recharge

Schedule some time regularly where you can be alone and recharge, so you're ready to be present when interacting with others. If you have a meeting or a phone call with a client, schedule some [recovery time](http://coschedule.com/blog/marketing-for-introverts/) alone afterward.

### 5. Rehearse Your Story
 
Many of us, myself included, sometimes struggle with talking about ourselves. Writing and rewriting your bio will help you learn to talk about yourself. In an interview for the Society of Actuaries, Nancy Ancowitz recommends keeping a list of your accomplishments and writing down favorable comments you’ve received. Then, you're prepared when someone questions you about your background. If you've scheduled an important call with a client, write out your talking points beforehand, and you’ll be more prepared and confident.

### 6. Remember Your Strengths and Your Value

Finally, don't be intimidated by marketing. Marketing simply involves finding the right people and sharing what you do with them. All marketing is communication, and we all communicate in one way or another, whether through snail mail or SnapChat. View your introversion as a strength: you are analytical, self-motivated, focused, creative, and a good listener. Capitalize on those strengths and use them to become an invaluable member of your marketing team. 

Plus, according to [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2014/07/why-marketing-needs-more-introverts/), introverted leaders produce more profits and productivity than extroverted leaders. As consumers become more involved, listening will become an even more important asset for tomorrow’s marketer.

Through finding the right marketing strategies for you and managing your time and energy wisely, you can turn your introversion from an obstacle into a strength.
