As a marketing professional, you have a lot on your plate. You probably have several marketing campaigns to manage simultaneously. You’re under pressure to produce better results in less time. 

You also have to regularly evaluate the effectiveness of your marketing and advertising. As you evaluate your marketing’s effectiveness, you find areas that need improvement. Now, you have more copy that needs produced— more work than you can handle on your own.

If you're considering hiring a copywriter to help you keep up with the long list of projects on your schedule, (or maybe even get ahead of schedule), then seeking outside assistance will be a worthwhile endeavor.

### Get The Clarity and Information You Need 

First, a copywriter provides an outside perspective on your business. When I meet with you as a client, I gain information about your current marketing methods and your goals. I also research your industry and competitors, and I gain further insights into how you could improve your marketing. This saves you time because you gain insight about your industry, providing information you otherwise would need to research yourself. I also propose steps that you could take to improve your marketing, which helps prevent “paralysis of analysis.”

### An Expert Gets the Job Done Quickly…
You’re saving time by hiring someone who specializes in copywriting. Hiring someone who is trained in direct response would be more effective than working with someone who has never written copy before. 

If you or your team were to train themselves in copywriting, you would need to invest several hours a day over several months. In becoming a copywriter, I've spent many hours over many months learning direct response secrets and perfecting my writing skills. I've attended writing workshops, read dozens of copywriting books, and studied current marketing trends. That background helps me get the job done more quickly.

### Get the Copy Right the First Time, and Get it Published Faster 
Hiring  a copywriter saves you time because there is a higher likelihood that his or her copy will be effective. When I write copy for a client, I take the time to read all of the materials that the client sends me, and I ensure I understand all the features of their products. I set aside several hours or days to conduct research to ensure I have complete information before I begin writing. 

I also understand that the most effective messaging is achieved through testing, so I can provide my client with several alternative headlines for the copy should they choose to perform an A/B split test.

Finding someone who takes the time to write quality copy the first time means fewer revisions later. The fewer rounds of revisions necessary, the faster the copy can be sent out in the mail or published on your website. Quality copy also reduces the need for future copy updates or rewrites, which saves you money and time spent starting new projects.

As a marketer, your time is important and highly limited. Therefore, it's important to hire a professional copywriter who can help you improve your marketing and save you time.
