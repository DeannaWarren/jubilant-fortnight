When I was in college, I sat through six different seminars on research techniques. After two or three of these lectures, I felt like an expert researcher. Why, I wondered, do so many classes spend so much time teaching students how to search the internet and use online databases?

### 3 Reasons Research Improves Profits

According to [Internet Live Stats](http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/), more than 3.42 billion people used the internet in 2016. In the past ten years, internet use increased 294.8%. As use of the internet becomes more and more pervasive, I'm glad that I spent so much time learning how to research. Here are 3 reasons why thorough research online and offline is important:

1. Thorough research gathers the highest-quality information, which you can then share with others as [high-quality content](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/ingredients-of-great-content/). Readers value content that is well-researched and well-written. Plus, your website will receive better search rankings.

2. While gathering high-quality information takes time, persistence and discipline, research is worthwhile because you gain insight that no one else has. While some information is readily available online, tracking down obscure books or contacting subject matter experts can be time-consuming. Therefore, conducting research will help you explode your business and distinguish yourself from other companies in your industry.

3. Much of the information available online is inaccurate or contradictory. Sharing inaccurate information online is not just embarrassing— it will also irritate your readers and hurt your bottom line. As a researcher, I've learned how to evaluate whether a website, newspaper or book is sharing reputable information. There are clues to look for to see if a source is trustworthy, and learning which clues to look for takes time and experience.

### Why Obtaining Complete Information Pays Off

When I was writing my research paper, "The Effects of the Therapeutic Relationship in Psychiatric Music Therapy," I began by searching peer-reviewed journals specific to the field of Music Therapy. I searched through decades of back issues one by one, as not all of the articles were archived electronically. These three journals were a good starting point, but if I had simply relied on them, I would have missed other information, and my research would have been incomplete.

Next, I used online databases and discovered international journals with articles about my subject. I also discovered several books containing chapters on the topic. Gathering information and analyzing its quality took many hours over several months. Organizing information is important, so you can keep it for future use. Along the way, I developed a system for keeping track of the key information from each paper I read. 

### How to Evaluate the Quality of Information
As I read, I evaluated the information and decided what to include in my study. Some of the criteria I considered were: 

* __Recency__: When was this information published?
* __Authorship__: Was the author a reputable source of information? What were their credentials?
* __Sources__: Was the author using other credible sources to support their claims, or were they offering their opinion? Were the sources they referenced available to review?

### Big Ideas from Research Yielded Immediate Results

Once I had read the resources, I would then read other articles they cited to gather even more information. Over the course of this project, I read over 300 papers. Many of the papers were contradictory, and my job was to resolve those differences and draw conclusions.

My conclusions synthesized the information in to big ideas others could use. For example, one of the big ideas from the paper was that mentally ill patients respond well to group games and activities. My colleagues and I started using group games in our Music Therapy sessions, and it immediately improved patient engagement. While this was just one seemingly simple idea, its implementation yielded immediate results.

### Thorough Research Leads to Big Ideas

Now, in my work as a copywriter, I enjoy searching for big ideas I can use in web writing. Through extensive research, I create powerful ideas to increase my client's profits. If an idea is powerful enough, the company can incorporate it throughout their marketing— on their website homepage, in their salesletter, in the email newsletter they send out every week, in their PPC ads on Google, or in their social media posts.
