Your life experiences have prepared you to be a marketer. How can you use those experiences to improve your marketing?

While you might have thought that your life experiences were unrelated to your work as a marketing professional, the skills and experiences you've can be leveraged to greater success.

I studied Music Therapy and piano at [University of the Pacific](http://www.pacific.edu/Academics/Schools-and-Colleges/Conservatory-of-Music.html), and Iâ€™ve worked as a [Music Therapist](http://www.musictherapy.org/about/musictherapy/). While I originally didn't think that I was prepared to work in marketing, I've since realized that my experiences have helped me become a better marketer. Here are 9 skills and lessons that I have learned from music:

### 1. Ask Great Questions in Assessments and Interviews

When I interned at a mental hospital, I interviewed new patients as they were admitted. These interviews taught me how to be a better listener. As I listened to my patient's stories, I improved my interview techniques, such as asking follow-up questions. I also developed various assessment activities to observe how the patients interacted with each other.

I systemized the assessments and interview process and shared the information I gathered with other therapists and team members. In marketing, interviewing skills help me add more value to my clients and gain a deeper understanding of their needs. Using a system also helps ensure that I ask the right questions.

### 2. Learn to Listen and Accept Feedback

As a piano student, I attended three or four lessons every week as I prepared for my junior and senior recitals. I received a great deal of feedback about my musical skills, and I spent several hours each day incorporating that feedback as part of my performance.

Similarly, as I perfected my copywriting skills, this discipline helped me learn quickly. I remember my professor's disappointment when I failed to demonstrate I had properly learned what he had taught me. When working with clients, I make sure I listen to their feedback and avoid causing frustration. I show them that I'm listening to them by implementing their suggestions quickly.

### 3. Anticipate and Process Contradictory Information

When preparing for my piano recitals, I worked with two piano professors. They were both extremely talented musicians, but sometimes their suggestions for me seemed contradictory. In these cases, I found ways to incorporate the contradictory feedback and resolve those differences independently. When researching, there is often conflicting information, and it's my responsibility to resolve those differences and present the most accurate and relevant data.

### 4. Musical Reciprocity

When working with a client in Music Therapy, I assess the client's emotional level and mirror that emotion. For example, if a client is sad, I begin a session with slower songs. Once I've mirrored the client's emotions, then I can use music to change their emotional state. For the sad patient, I would move gradually from slow to faster, upbeat music.

This concept is known as the [isoprinciple,](http://jontewilson.tripod.com/theory.html) and I believe it manifests itself in marketing, as well. It's important to identify your prospect's problem or "bleeding neck" before you can show how your product is the solution. In order to market your product more effectively, you use your prospect's language and identify emotions they are likely to respond to.

### 5. Research Your Target Market 

Before I would meet with a new Music Therapy client, I would interview other members on my team who had worked with that client. I would find out what other therapists had done that worked well with that client. I would read their chart to find out about their diagnosis and what their problems were. Before I led a group, I researched the literature for what was successful with that population.

Similarly, I believe it's important to know what marketing campaigns have succeeded in your company and to learn from what was not successful. Researching other companies in your industry can be helpful as well as learning about companies in other industries with similar problems

### 6. Test and Evaluate Your Marketing

Just because I STRONGLY believe in research does not mean you should be afraid of experimentation. No matter how well you know your industry and your clients, at some point you will be faced with a new challenge that no one else has encountered before. In one of my music groups, I had a very talented musician who had difficulty counting rests (silent intervals) in the music. I solved this solution by teaching him to drum in the air during the rests.

In some situations, you have to make educated guesses about what will succeed in your market and then evaluate progress, improve and revise your marketing.

### 7. Prove Amazing Value Beyond Your Core Service

When I gave a piano performance, the audience attended because they assumed that I already knew how to play piano. What they came to hear was my individual interpretation of the timeless classics like Bach or Beethoven. Similarly, when I worked at the mental hospital, my supervisors assumed that I was a competent musician and therapist, and that with training I would be ready to lead groups and conduct assessments.

When you sell your product to a client, the client assumes that your service offers what you say it offers. For example, when you go to dinner at a fancy restaurant, you're paying for the gourmet meal. You also receive great service and therefore have a delightful experience. In order to provide excellent experiences for our customers, we have to understand our client's expectations and overcome their skepticism.

### 8. Know Your Value and Be Ready to Prove It

When I worked in an assisted living facility, many staff initially didn't appreciate the value of the music groups I led. I explained to them how my work would help their patients, but they didn't always understand. After leading groups for several months, the staff started voluntarily helping me set up, pass out instruments, and encourage patients to attend the groups. They did so because they witnessed the value the patients gained.

To reach the point where customers buy into your product, you have to believe in the effectiveness of your marketing and give it time to produce results.

### 9. Practice Like You're Performing, Perform Like It's Practice

When I'm practicing for a performance, I'll record myself and pretend I'm playing for an audience. When I'm performing for an audience, I'm so engrossed in the music I forget the audience exists. When you're producing marketing materials, view them as if you are your prospect. Imagine what their reaction will be. When you're producing content, ask yourself: If I were the buyer, why would I want to read this? Be aware that your marketing message and materials will need to change periodically, as well.
