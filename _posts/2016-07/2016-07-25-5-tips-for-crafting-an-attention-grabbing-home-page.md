Your home page is like a book jacket. You're browsing the bookshelf at your local bookstore when a title catches your eye. You scan it quickly and you're intrigued, so you open the book and flip through it. If it interests you, then you buy the book and take it home.

A website homepage is like a book jacket because it has 4 purposes. Your home page must: 

* Grab your reader's attention
* Communicate your most important messages
* Help them quickly find what they need
* Develop trust and credibility

Your home page must communicate a wealth of information in a small amount of time and space. How can you make your home page grab attention AND hold on to it?

### 1. Get Attention with the Headline

First, the headline must incorporate your unique value proposition. The headline is what grabs the reader's attention. Be short and succinct. Make sure that your headline matches with your logo and slogan to showcase [your company’s identity](http://www.keywebconcepts.com/blog/2010/08/16/the-importance-of-your-sites-homepage/). Once you have their attention, tell them why they should read on…

### 2. Show The Reader Who You Are

Second, use text and images to expand on your headline. Usually this consists of a short paragraph (100-150 words) that gives the reader some information and tells them why they're interested. Make sure to target first-time readers and repeat visitors by linking to different content they each will find relevant. Select content that targets each phase of the buyer’s journey. How do you know what to say on your home page?

### 3. Remain customer-focused

write your homepage from the customer's point of view rather than from your own. Many websites use their home page to introduce their company. Most readers aren't interested in company information at first, as they’re actually looking for information about the problems you solve. Focus on the benefits your products and services offer. But having the right information on your home  page isn’t enough…

### 4. Help Visitors Find Information

Having a clear navigation section helps your visitors quickly find the information they’re looking for. Using standard page titles such as About and Contact tell the visitor exactly what they’ll be reading. The more pages you have on your website, the more organized your navigation needs to be. Simultaneously, you also need to provide links to bring your reader deeper into your website and encourage them to keep reading. 

### 5. Establish Trust and Credibility

Once you’ve gained the reader’s attention and educated them about the problems you solve, how do you establish trust? In order to gain the prospect’s trust, you need to establish credibility. The best way to appear credible is to obtain third-party verification. For example, a seal from the [Better Business Bureau](https://www.bbb.org/) proves you have a legitimate and well-respected business. 

Credibility can also be demonstrated through testimonials and case studies, which showcase your happy customers using the product. Also consider including social proof elements, such as the number of readers of your e-newsletter. If you demonstrate credibility and avoid hype, you’ll be well on your way to gaining their interest and earning their trust.

To conclude, your home page is one of the most important pages on your website because it’s the page most visitors view first. You must grab the visitor’s attention and maintain it to convert them to a lead. As you evaluate your home page keeping these tips in mind, consider your home page from your reader’s point of view. You could consider soliciting feedback from your visitors as well.
