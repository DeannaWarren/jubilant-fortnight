In 2016, [78% of Americans](http://www.statista.com/statistics/273476/percentage-of-us-population-with-a-social-network-profile/) have a social media profile. With so many opportunities to engage customers online, the question is no longer whether you should take advantage of social media marketing—The question is how should you BEST spend your time and effort on social media. 


Before you can begin posting great content and attracting qualified prospects to your website, you MUST have a high-quality profile so that visitors to your profile page are attracted to find out more. When I'm helping a client manage their social media profiles, there are a number of factors I consider.

### Have You Provided Exceptional Profile Information?

Have you filled out all of the information on your profile? Completing this information increases the likelihood your profile will be found by others who are looking for information about you, your company, or companies like yours. Make sure you include the following:

1. Contact Information: While some customers will contact you through social media, others will want to reach out for more details. Direct them to your website for general information, and also direct them to a specific resource, such as a free guide, where the majority of your visitors start learning about your product or service. Finally, provide a phone number, email, physical address, or any other information so they can reach out to you for more information using their preferred communication method.

2. Vanity URL: Use your name or company name in the URL of your social media account, aka your [vanity URL.](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/successful-social-media-profile/) This will help your SEO and help you rank in search results. That way, your prospects find you when they search for you, rather than finding your competition. You may also wish to include your links in your email signature or on business cards, and vanity URLs make you look more professional.

3. Photo: Include a logo, headshot or other visual that best represents you or your company. Include your name in the filename for SEO purposes. Make sure to follow the recommended size requirements—visit this [cheatsheet](http://makeawebsitehub.com/social-media-image-sizes-cheat-sheet/) from Jamie Spencer. Save time by taking advantage of helpful [image creation tools](https://blog.bufferapp.com/tools-create-images-for-social-media) like Canva and Pablo. 

4. Detailed Bio: Help potential customers find you by including a carefully crafted About section. This section shoul tell your company's story and includes a variety of targeted keywords. Make sure your bio tells the reader what your company does and who you are. Use the full space provided to your advantage. For example, LinkedIn allows a maximum of 2,000 characters for your Summary, and you can also link to your website and attach files. 

### You Have a Profile…What’s Next?
5. Testing and Analytics: Before you set up multiple profiles on several platforms, consider which networks your customers use most frequently. Consider tracking which networks are driving the most traffic to your website or blog. As you post content, it’s important to regularly evaluate the success of your posts. For example, you can test: posting schedules, types of content and headlines. Ideally, once you have completed your profiles, you want to prepare for a successful marketing campaign by setting up tracking tools and determining the metrics you will use to evaluate yourself.

6. Evaluate Your Privacy Settings: If you want your social content read by the greatest number of people, you may want to consider making your profile public. On the other hand, you may not want to publicly share every single post. Determine your comfort level and adjust your privacy settings accordingly.

7. Establish a Posting Schedule: It’s important to establish and maintain a regular schedule. For example, you might plan to share 3 posts daily, 5 days a week. This will generate a large volume of posts and increase engagement. Many companies post irregularly and receive few likes, comments and shares. Consistently sharing content keeps you top of mind with your followers when your updates are shared to their feeds. Companies who regularly share updates appear engaged with their customers.

8. Share Varied Content: Many companies share articles or company updates on social media. Viewers on social media are interested in many types of content, especially multimedia content. Sharing multiple types of content also reaches different clients with different interests. Content with images receive [94% more views]http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/visual-content-marketing-strategy#sm.00001r3ua7590vcx8yf13d7d9p449) than content without images.
