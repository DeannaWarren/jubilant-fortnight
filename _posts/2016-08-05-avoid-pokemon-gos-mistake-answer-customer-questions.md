If you haven’t heard, Pokemon Go has gone from the most beloved game on the app store to one of the most hated in just a few weeks. Due to Niantic’s removal of their ‘nearby’ feature and other issues, upset fans have requested refunds, left negative reviews, and [used social media](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/31/pokemon-go-fans-devastated-after-game-update-resets-their-progre/) to encourage others to do likewise. The bigger issue with Niantec’s marketing strategy is their lack of communication with their fans. As [Patricia Hernandez](http://kotaku.com/even-pokemon-gos-biggest-fans-are-turning-against-it-ri-1784654305) put it, “In 2016, it is not enough to build and launch the most popular game of the year. You have to talk to people, earn their trust, develop a relationship.”

Fortunately, Niantic has posted an explanation [to Pokemon Go’s Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/PokemonGO/posts/940141879465704). In part, they said, “If you haven’t heard us Tweeting much it’s because we’ve been heads down working on the game. But we’ll do our best going forward to keep you posted on what’s going on.”

While it’s easy to understand that such a small company with a large fan base would be overwhelmed with feature development and solving technical difficulties, hopefully Niantic will place a higher priority on answering customer’s questions going forward.

### Why Customer Communication is Critical…

Communication with customers is critical because it helps you understand their experience. Building great relationships online is a [necessary part of doing business](http://www.sightcall.com/4-ways-build-better-customer-relationships-online/) in 2016 and beyond.

If it’s a mistake to fail to communicate transparently with your fans—and a costly mistake that can have a SERIOUS impact on your business’s success— how should you go about communicating with your fan and followers? Clearly Niantec should have made public announcements as they updated their app. How can you avoid their mistake by answering customer questions?

### The Benefits of Answering Questions Through Content Marketing


Answering questions online builds relationships by reducing friction with your customers. When you demonstrate expertise, it also helps them trust you and your brand. Answering questions through content marketing is also an excellent self-promotion tool. Answering questions through content marketing: 

* Generates social shares and links: Since users will find your content helpful, they’ll want to share it with their followers. For example, [this content marketing guide](https://startupbuffer.com/resources/content-marketing-for-startups/) received 15,000 social shares. As your content gains more shares and links from other websites, your search engine ranking will improve as well. 
* Helps you outperform your competition: Since your competitors generally aren’t using this technique, you’ll provide more information than they do, and thus your engagement will be higher. 
* Creates longevity: Answering customer questions creates useful content that your readers will still be using and referring to years later. 

Answering customer questions is a great way to improve [conversion rate optimization](http://marketingland.com/answering-customers-questions-will-make-way-willing-convert-131280). Plus, the more pages of content you have on your website, the more calls to action you can make, which may lead to increased leads. High-quality content also reduces bounce rate and increases the length of time users spend on your site. 

### 6 Simple Ways to Determining the Right Questions to Answer

Now you know you why you need to answer your customer’s questions on your website. But, maybe you're not sure what your customer’s questions are. Or, perhaps you’re not sure which questions are asked most commonly by your readers. Where can you find the questions your customers are asking?

* Ask your sales team: If you work at a mid-size company, your sales team will be fielding questions from leads on a daily basis. Reach out to them and ask which questions they’re answering most frequently. They often have scripted answers for those questions, which you can draw from to create your content.
* Customer emails: Collect questions from customer emails and search for common themes. Since emails can be longer than social media posts, you may gain insight into why the customer is asking certain questions.
* Social media discussions and forums: [Social listening](https://mic.com/articles/27173/7-ways-startups-can-better-manage-customer-relationships#.mWxm7xzmY) helps you stay on top of industry trends, determine overall customer sentiment, and keep up with problems customers have.
* Customer surveys: Reach out to your email list or social following with short polls. Surveys with open-ended questions can tell you about customer problems and needs.
* Webinars and Google+ Hangouts: I was on a webinar on Monday with 800+ people. Webinars generally have a Q&A section, with multiple questions and comments to mine for ideas. You could also explore your competitor’s webinars if you don’t run your own.
* Keyword search data from Google Analytics: Keyword search data will help you see which terms your users are searching for, so you can include those in your content.  

### Super-Charge Your Content With 9 Crucial Elements

Once you’ve discovered your customer’s burning questions, it’s time to write content that answers those questions.

[Content on your website](http://www.inboundmarketingagents.com/inbound-marketing-agents-blog/bid/190442/Complete-Guide-to-Answering-Customer-Questions-on-Your-Business-Blog) should:
