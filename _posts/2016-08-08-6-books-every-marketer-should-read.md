As marketers, salespeople, and entrepreneurs, it’s important to continually educate ourselves. There is so much information out there: podcasts, webinars, blogs, newspapers, email newsletters, training programs… With our schedules already full, it can be tempting to ignore one of the greatest resources available: books.

As a bibliophile, (I’ve read 20+ books in the past year) I think reading is worthwhile because of the knowledge you can gain that otherwise isn’t available. Stories expand your imagination, and challenging ideas change your perspective on the world.

In other words, if you don’t take time every day to read 10 pages, or listen to 15 minutes of an audiobook, you’re missing out. Here are 6 classic books that have helped me become a better marketer and copywriter over the past year:

### 1. Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion by Robert Cialdini

Influence is a great introduction into the world of persuasion, as it shows how individuals, companies, and the media are convincing us to do what they want on a daily basis. Even if you’re not a marketer, car salesman, or charity fundraiser, understanding how to influence others and how you’re being influenced is eye-opening. The most interesting lessons are on social proof and how we can be fooled when it’s faked. Cialdini investigates the psychology of cults such as the Jonestown Massacre, where 918 people drank poison because they followed the example of other cult members. You can learn more about Robert Cialdini at [his website](https://www.influenceatwork.com/).
 
### 2. Ogilvy on Advertising by David Ogilvy 

David Ogilvy is one of the giants of advertising, who founded one of the top advertising agencies in the world, Ogilvy and Mather. This book provides practical writing tips and shares stories and anecdotes from Ogilvy’s life. If you want to get your emails opened or make your writing easy to read, this book will help. You can find the book on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Ogilvy-Advertising-David/dp/039472903X) (note: these are NOT affiliate links.)
 
### 3. The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference by Malcolm Gladwell

As someone who has always ben interested in psychology, this book was a fascinating read from cover to cover. The tipping point is the moment when an idea or trend become widespread or goes viral. This book is a must read for any marketer who wants to understand how to promote products or create buzz around a new idea. Now that I’ve read it, I hear people discussing and using its ideas in articles, podcasts, and webinars everywhere. Understanding the ideas in this book seem to me almost a prerequisite for successful online marketing today. You can find out more at [Malcolm Gladwell’s website](http://gladwell.com/the-tipping-point/).

### 4. How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie

It’s hard to succeed in business or in anything without good people skills. If you can’t communicate respectfully and understand other people’s needs, you’ll be hurting your chances for success. This holds true in marketing: If you can’t communicate how a product helps someone else, then they’re not going to buy the product. This book shares powerful lessons through highly relatable stories from history, like an anecdote about Abraham Lincoln. Here’s a great summary from the [HubSpot blog](http://www.hubspot.com/sales/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people-summary), and you can download the book [here](http://www.yourcoach.be/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Dale-Carnegie-How-to-win-friends-and-influence-people.pdf).

### 5. Leadership and Self-Deception by the Arbinger Institute

I’m grateful to my mentor, Joshua Boswell, for recommending this book. The lessons within are truly life-changing—they’ll change the way you view and interact with other people. This book elegantly couches complicated ideas in simple terms in the form of a parable. The big idea: we often unconsciously treat people as objects, when we should treat them as people. The book shows how to shift your attitude by getting “out of the box” and reach your full potential. To find out what that means, you can visit [The Arbinger Institute](https://arbinger.com/product/leadership-and-self-deception/).
 
### 6. The Slight Edge: Secret to a Successful Life by Jeff Olson

This book teaches the cultivation of simple habits to improve yourself and your life, tiny step by tiny step. It also teaches how small decisiions make a huge impact over time. It helped me take responsibility for the decisions I make day by day, moment by moment. I’ve used the ideas in this book to restart my exercise routine and increase my productivity. I read this book over a weekend, and while it was enjoyable, I would recommend reading this book slowly, one chapter at a time. That way you’ll have time to apply the concepts and ideas in the book. You can get the book [here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0967285550?ie=UTF8&tag=timemanahabi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0967285550).

### Bonus: What I’m Currently Reading 

I like to read first thing in the morning, in the evening before bed, and I often take short breaks throughout the day to read for a few minutes. The audiobook I’m listening to right now is The Power of Vulnerability by Brene Brown, a series of lectures on vulnerability and how we so desperately avoid it. Dr. Brown is a social worker and rsearcher, and I enjoy how she combines her research findings with personal anecdotes throughout.

I’ve also begun The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey, and I’ve just finished re-reading Lock In by John Scalzi, my favorite science fiction author. I used to only read one book at a time, but I now prefer to read multiple books at once. I usually read one business or self-improvement book and one fiction book simultaneously.
