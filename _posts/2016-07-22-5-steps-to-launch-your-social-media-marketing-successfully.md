According to comScore, users spent [230 billion minutes](https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Blog/Which-Social-Networks-Have-the-Most-Engaged-Audience) on Facebook in 2015. Social media presents a remarkable opportunity for any business looking to generate more traffic and turn it into leads. If your business is just getting started with social media, you may be overwhelmed by the plethora of platforms, marketing strategies to choose from, and other decisions to make. Here are 5 suggestions to help you start on the path to successful social media marketing: 

### 1. Select platforms to meet your goals.

First off, how many social networks should you invest your precious time in? You’ll need to evaluate how much time and money to invest into social media marketing. Most likely, you’re marketing through a number of channels, such as email, websites, affiliates, in-person, print, radio, or TV. In The Zen of Social Media Marketing, Shama Kabani recommends “Ideally, you should focus on two social networking sites and go deep. Understand the rules, cultivate relationships, and get comfortable using them for business.” Which platforms should you choose? In [this post from the Kissmetrics blog,](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/which-social-accounts-matter/) Neil Patel recommends joining “the Big Four”: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+. You will also want to consider where your audience can be found on social media and focus on those platforms.

### 2. Set goals: Launch a social media campaign around specific goals.

Have a clear demographic profile of the user you’re targeting and the content you want them to read. Are you considering launching a paid ad campaign? The more targeted you are about the reader you’re marketing to, the less expensive your ad campaign will be. Goals for your social media marketing could include:

* Increase traffic to your website or blog
* Share company and customer stories
* Seek feedback from customers 
* Develop relationships with your prospects and customers 

Make sure that your goals are measurable and have a specific goal date. For example, your goal might be to increase page views of your blog posts by 10% in the next 6 months. 

Once you’ve selected your platforms and established your goals, it’s time to set up profiles and start interacting with your audience.

### 3. Engage in Conversation.

Asking questions and providing interesting content are two great ways to increase engagement. You can ask questions about: 

* Your reader’s challenges and motivations 
* How they use your products and services and 
* What they think about your content. 

Don’t make the mistake of talking about yourself or your brand too often.

### 4. Be Succinct and Helpful.

Share useful content succinctly. You have limited space on social networks and high competition for your reader’s attention. Many clients are browsing quickly through their feeds on mobile and won't stop to read a post that looks long and intimidating. Even when they do read your post, the majority of your readers won't click the "read more" link, so get to the point quickly. 

Use hashtags when posting your content to help readers and search engines find your content. Hashtags also give you a way to track how your content influences the conversation. Including 2-3 well-researched keywords will increase social shares. Use your hashtags to turn your readers into advocates for your brand.

### 5. Save Time Cross-posting.

Cross-posting content will save you time because it helps you share content on multiple platforms. However, you also want to give your followers a reason to follow each of your separate social channels, so consider this when using cross-posting tools. Also, pay attention to formatting when using social sharing tools, as text may be cut off and images may be removed. 

In summary, in order to succeed on social media, you need to 

* Select the best social networks for your business
* Set concrete, measurable goals for your marketing plan
* Engage in conversation with your audience by asking questions
* Share concise posts and use hashtags
* Use cross-posting to save time
